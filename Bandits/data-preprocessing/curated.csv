General Hospital with Luke and Laura was the big thing on Tv and so was Dallas and any Sugar Ray  Leonard fight,but in Music there was One Guy who was on the pulse of that year  and his Name was Rick James. Being from Buffalo,New York myself or B-lo as we call it leaves alot of memorys. that summer in taking that our Hometown Boy had truly blown up with a Album that was a Blue-Print for the Future in Funk,Pop,R&B;, and even more so where Rap Music was concearned. the truth is that ""Street Songs"" was the Blue-Print for what Rap Music was to become in terms of talking about issues that not many artists in any style were bold enough to talk about.  Rick James was the People\'s champion of the Street and for folks who didn\'t care about Ronald Reagan and his Racist tired ways. Rick James made that album that for the Hood, the Burbs and everywhere else in between,but yet He stayed R&B; and always had that Street Respect.Give it to me baby 1) the horns the story line and the say what  catch phrase were all felt. that is trademark Rick Riff right there. the bass, the Groove and the give it to me.  not many artists would make a song where they admit to being to High to making love to there Ole Lady. Rick allowed himself to be vulnerable and the song caught on big time. there hasn\'t really been another song that hit like that with that kind of storyline and detail.that song still packs a whole lot of punch and it has been sampled,looped,etc.... so many times since then.Ghettp Life 2) who else was talking about playing frezze tag with Winos? I mean He talked about everything Hood and it kept it real. the Bass groove was slamming. the line one thing about the Ghetto is that it will be there tommorow so people don\'t you worry is both creative and witty,but at the same time sad. but a reality.Make Love to Me 3) very intoxicating Rhythm and Mellow groove that changes tempo but works. very Jazzesque in terms of the Progression. very smooth.a strong vocal performance by Rick.good strong arrangements.Narada Michael Walden gives a nice touch on the drums.Mr.PoliceMan 4) way before NWA came out with F*** tha police"" Rick James spoke of Racial Profiling and other situations and he kept it real. this Song had a strong Reggae Bob Marley feel to it. Stevie Wonder knocks out the harmonica part. Teena Marie\'s part works and compliments the song as well.  very honest song. very direct.Super Freak 5) call this the Pay Day Jam. New Wavy with the Funk at the Bottom. twisted lines about the wrong kind of girl to take home to your Mother. but it works. the groove works and the lyrics are funny,but effective. the Longer version is extra Crispy Funky. Rick found a Groove and a song that has been sampled,used,etc... so much it ain\'t even funny. this is One of those classic Songs that is timeless and will never be forgotten.Fire and Desire 6) Rick James and Teena Marie made a slow Jam classic here and for my money there hasn\'t been a better duet in the past 25 plus years. the passion, intensity and the overall arrangements and vibe of this song is timeless. Rick gets into Opera on this Classic. the trade-off is classic. this is the kind of song where you break up but you still got strong feelings for your Ex. mos people can relate to that. teena marie around the time was in the Hospital with a 109 degree temperture but she came on down to the studio and knocked this jam out.  Classic and great Musical drama.Call Me Up 7) Pre Cell Phone and early days of the Message box where you\'d call somebody and leave a Message this song is basically that. now the groove and Rhythm here is on point and also Rick dropped a tight Rap Flow that hasn\'t always been acknowledged.  the groove itself is very in line with the way Rap Music would go. Rick song the song as if He was Crooning. the range was way up there and he made it work. he nailed it and this song is still cold.i dig the broadway swing of this cut.i dug the latin Percussion break and swinging Horns.tight background vocals.Below the Funk 8)a  Funky Groove Message to the haters directly. nobody else was doing a cut like this back then. a cool ending and on point. this song was loose and the groove is bumping.a cstraight up  Shout out about B-LO.Props to the Stone city band for there Contributions, Lady T. Teena Marie who left a strong impact on this album. Props to Tom Flye.this album Paved the way to keeping the funk but also balancing out the Pop textures which would later take Michael Jackson,Prince, Lionel Richie,Bobby Brown,R.Kelly,Outkast and others across and Beyond into a Wider audience.""Street Songs"" was that Album that paved the way in the early 80\'s and it hasn\'t gotten it\'s full due. but Rick James was a Musical Genius and he left a strong Impact on the music World and His Music deserves to get the full long overdue it deserves and this Classic Album speaks volumes then as it does now.', 'overall': 5.0, 'summary': 'Classic

Don't get me wrong, i mean EVER.  His lyrical skills are incredible, one of the all-time greatest emcee's.

A nice chorus too, with coo music.The Grand Finale - features everyone from N.W.A, many people say this is the best song on the album, but for me it's the 2nd best.  All of N.W.A couldnt come better here, all coming with tight verses, especially Eazy-E and The D.O.C (obviously).  The beat here is one of the best on the whole album.

ALONG WITH HIS GROUP, NATAS! check out these albums by them:Esham - Boomin Words From HellEsham - Kkkill The FetusEsham - Closed Casket (HOT HOT ALBUM!)Esham - Dead FlowerzEsham - Judgement Day Vol 1Esham - Judgement Day Vol 2Esham - Bruce Wayne: Gothom City 1987Natas - Life After DeathNatas - Blaz4meNatas - Doubelievengod (HOT HOT ALBUM!)Natas - Multikillionaire: The Devil's ContractNatas - WWW.COM (Wicket World Wide)all these albums are INSTANT classics and are all better than this album, so if u think this album is good, then u MUST check out these albums because they are JUST INDESCRIBABLE!6 Feet Deep is a good album but it wont get much credit when my standards are set by Esham's and Natas' albums. Every album listed above are all better than ANY OTHER RAP ALBUM. but this album is one that should be added to your collection, however, im encouraging you to add as many natas and esham albums as you can, a good start would be Esham's Closed Casket, Boomin Words From Hell, Kkkill The Fetus, and Dead Flowerz albums, and all the Natas albums that i listed. The rap game is one big big game...but really it died in about 1999. NOTHING will ever be able to compare to these ESHAM and NATAS underground classics, not even the great 6 Feet Deep.FINALLY, Gravediggaz came out with this album (there best album) but every other they came out with came nowhere near and just dropped off in the standard. Esham came out with Boomin Words From Hell and just kept coming out with classic after classic, along with Natas. Over 20 classics from Natas & Esham came out in less than 10 years, making their intentions clear that they stay true to their style, and keep the underground alive. im out"", 'overall': 3.0, 'summary': 'THEY ARE NOT ORIGINAL', 'unixReviewTime': 1091059200, 'reviewTime': '07 29, 2004'}","{'reviewerID': 'A2MGMBB5F9NED', 'asin': 'B00000DHSH', 'reviewerName': 'Pete', 'helpful': [0, 0], 'reviewText': ""This album, along with every other eazy-e record is absolute classic.

The huge beats on ""When The Going Gets Tough"", which was his only #1 hit, and his second biggest hit ""Get Out Of My Dreams"" were really catchy and even enchanting to me as a child, but if I listen to them now in the library at Melbourne University they seem awfully dated. The same is true of the earlier ""Carribbean Queen"", whilst ""License To Chill"" is even worse in this respect.The slower material, to which Billy\'s ""big"" voice was never suited, comes off as even worse. I always thought ""Here\'s To You"" and ""Loverboy"" were terribly soppy, and it\'s easy to imagine how I would feel about them nowadays.This is something I want to note as something I have given up, and it is so dated with its big beat dance track and so soppy on the ballads that one should steer clear of it.', 'overall': 1.0, 'summary': 'A dated childhood memory par excellence', 'unixReviewTime': 1195430400, 'reviewTime': '11 19, 2007'}","{'reviewerID': 'AKNSC7IXWEYLA', 'asin': 'B000000EE2', 'reviewerName': 'mianfei', 'helpful': [11, 12], 'reviewText': 'Joan Baez\' third album ""In Concert Part One"" remains the quintessential album of the 1960s folk revival and stands on its own as a remarkably beautiful piece of music.

Although her version of ""Matty Groves"" does not quite match the astonishing rendition fromLiege and Lief, it still tells a brutal tale. Malvina Reynolds\' ""What Have They Done to the Rain"", on the other hand, was Baez\' first move into the realm of the protest song yet is remarkably touching and intimate with its simple yet powerful metaphor of the grass dying from poisoned rainwater.The dark, despairing imagery is blackest on ""House Carpenter\'s Daughter"", ""Geordie"" and ""Copper Kettle"", which are further proof of the amazingly touching yet beautiful imagery of traditional folk that proved the richest of veins for such artists as Fairport Convention and Steeleye Span during the 1970s.All Joan Baez albums up to the oft-misunderstoodBaptismare worth owning, but there is little doubt ""In Concert Part One"" is the finest hour of her career.

The song is not memorable like hit singles of the 1980s were, and the singer can never tell whether he wants to talk or actually to sing.This was perhaps the first song to be a hit AS background music on the radio, rather than from simple, catchy lyrics and vocals that had made hit singles before. As it stands today, this soundtrack rap album is almost a protype for the Backstreet Boys, who sound quite similar to Coolio, actually, even if they never rapped.If you like the Backstreet Boys or N\'Sync (no need for rudeness) you\'ll love this for the meandering melodies and total absence of memorable rhythms. if you want more substance, stay right away.

Indeed, as has been said many times before, they did something that had almost never been done.The amazing thing about ""Spiderland"" is the way in which Brian McMahan and David Pajo are able to make their guitars sound so soft and then turn into a ""loudness"" (that\'s really the wrong word) without the slightest trace of pomp as dominated on the short songs ofTweez. On the opening track ""Breadcrumb Trail"" the band sets the tone with a simple hybrid of folk guitars and almost punkish drums before the electric guitar enters to create an effect that hits one in the heart much more deeply than pompous metal or stadium rock ever could. ""Nosferatu Man"", though danceable, is the closest of ""Spiderland""\'s tracks toTweezand does not have the same impact, but with ""Don Aman"" Slint move further-ot than ever before. In the process they create a song in which every note seems to have the emotional effect of an entire song on most other albums. The guitar might seem like Joni Mitchell\'s""Coyote"", but it is so much sharper and slower. ""Crystalline"" might be a very apt word given the way in which each note is made for maximum impact.""Washer"", the longets track on the record, does not have quite the impact of ""Don, Aman"", but the stark instrumentation on most of the track is not only tender and beautiful but truly passionate. ""For Dinner"" is a surprisingly light instrumental piece that does not have the remarkable qualities of ""Spiderland""\'s best material, but the closer ""Good Morning Captain"" is really explosive, especially at the end when McMahan screams ""I miss you"" with the kind of helplessness that I myself often feel when in despair.Even if the second and fifth tracks are not up the remarkable standard of innovation and passion of the rest of the album, it is impossible not to give ""Spiderland"" the full five stars. A record of such genuine passion is a true treat not to be missed, and its influence on the post-rock generation through showing how music could be made more emotional than ever before is further reason to elevate ""Spiderland"" to a high status.', 'overall': 5.0, 'summary': 'Fiery yet quiet, ""Spiderland"" in its best moments deserves all the praise', 'unixReviewTime': 1193529600, 'reviewTime': '10 28, 2007'}","{'reviewerID': 'AKNSC7IXWEYLA', 'asin': 'B0000019KE', 'reviewerName': 'mianfei', 'helpful': [1, 1], 'reviewText': 'Slint\'s first albumTweezhad in the main been fairly generic thrash metal with unconventional vocals, but in a few moments its short songs did hint at something quite different and much harder to categorise.

The opening track, ""Glenn"", though it uses no acoustic guitars or vocals, has all the dynamic of songs like ""Good Morning, Captain"" and at times is even more ferocious thanSpiderlandever was. The other track, a complete rework of ""Rhoda"", the closing track on their first album, is louder and thus not quite so impressive, but it still possesses the emotional impact for which Slint are most justifiably praised wihtout falling prey to the somewhat overblown sound that is found on parts ofTweez.All in all, if you want to know where Slint developed their sound, this all-instrumental EP is the place to go.', 'overall': 5.0, 'summary': 'The beginnings of greatness', 'unixReviewTime': 1225324800, 'reviewTime': '10 30, 2008'}","{'reviewerID': 'AKNSC7IXWEYLA', 'asin': 'B000001A5X', 'reviewerName': 'mianfei', 'helpful': [5, 18], 'reviewText': 'Marvin Gaye\'s ""What\'s Going On"" has been consistently acclaimed as one of the best albums of all time since it came out in 1971, and is often seen as the moment black music liberated itself from the confines of mass production.For all the efforts Gaye might have made to deal with the opposition of his record company to focusing as he did on social issues, the music on ""What\'s Going On"" really does not live up to its reputation. UnlikeStevie Wonder,Sly Stoneor laterParliament, ""What\'s Going On"" is distinctly lightweight, even flyweight in tone. At times, indeed, Gaye\'s voice sounds even soppy and devoid of any emotion, notably on the famous title track.Only twice, on the two lesser-known tracks ""Flying High (In The Friendly Sky)"" and ""Right On"", is their really any passion and emotion. Whilst all of ""What\'s Going On"" is heavily orchestrated, only there does the orchestration enhance rather than blunt the groove in the music, so that in general ""What\'s Going On"" is one of many failed attempts from that period at orchestration in pop music.

In doing so, Wonder showed clearly that he was at the time the premier soul musician.Opener ""Too High"" showed considerable melodic growth compared to his previous albums, but it is a touching sad song about the dangers of hard drugs. ""Visions"" is even softer and entirely free of electronics, even featuring an acoustic guitar that showed Wonder must have had some interest in the more experimental music of the time - yet Wonder always gives the song his own spin. ""Living for the City"", the epic third track, is a very deserved masterpiece in which Wonder maintains a remarkably steady crescendo throughout each verse and backs it up with passionate lyrics about the problems of living in the ghetto. The dense groove of ""Living for the City"" is notable in that it never seems overblown even with the bass bass drum throughout the song.""Golden Lady"", the fourth track, is a beautiful love song, but with ""Higher Ground"" Wonder returns to social commentary with an anthemic, yet delightfully melodic song about a theme he was certainly preoccupied with at the time: the striving for a better world. The groove and Wonder\'s voice, though, are much tighter than on his previous album, and there is an urgency lacking on parts of ""Talking Book"". ""Jesus Children of America"" continues in a slower vein of social commentary, whilst the closer ""He\'s Misstra Know-It-All"" is a beautiful song about the dark politics of the Richard Nixon era. The surprising thing about this song is that, like ""Living for the City"", Wonder can in a rare manner provide new energy in the middle of a song. ""All in Love Is Fair"" is a beautiful, moving ballad with an unexpectedly loud piano outro, and ""Don\'t You Worry About a Thing"" is a sparse, lighthearted, but quaint funk piece that showed Wonder capable of more different styles than one imagines his audience would have thought.All in all, if perhaps not quite the equal of ""Music of My Mind"", ""Innervisions"" deserves its status as one of the very best soul albums, showing a man who can master seemingly any style without effort and produce some of the very best social commentary ever put to record.', 'overall': 5.0, 'summary': ""Wonder's most political album - and a deserved classic"", 'unixReviewTime': 1248739200, 'reviewTime': '07 28, 2009'}","{'reviewerID': 'AKNSC7IXWEYLA', 'asin': 'B000001FCK', 'reviewerName': 'mianfei', 'helpful': [2, 2], 'reviewText': '1975\'sMothership Connectionand 1976\'sThe Clones of Dr. Funkensteinestablished George Clinton as a major commercial force in the United States, yet also showed them tigtening and intensifying their sound to produce some really powerful workout on songs like ""Unfunky UFO"".With ""Funkentelechy Vs. the Placebo Syndrome"", Parliament repeat the formula of a concept album about the war between funk (Funkentelechy) and the antifunk (the ""Placebo Syndrome"").

""Funkentelechy"" has fewer synthesisers but the powerful horns and drums that outstrip anything on a previous P-Funk record, together with Clinton\'s really memorable lyrics and the variety of voices throughout the piece from preachy to mysterious and touching, make this one of the most outstanding long songs of the 1970s. At no point over its eleven minutes does ""Funkentelechy"" become boring or predictable.All in all, P-Funk never sounded so tight, energetic and emotional as they did on ""Funkentelechy Vs. the Placebo Syndrome"".

Whilst Clinton\'s previous works had had some fine moments like ""You And Your Folks"" and ""Super Stupid"" on 1971\'sMaggot Brain, it was only withChocolate Citythat the band began to tighten up their dense funk enough to serious attract listeners.On ""Mothership Connection"", Clinton and his backing group turn to a conceptual masterpiece about the struggle of funk against the rest of the world and those who would destroy it. Whilst this might seem as cliched as AC/DC\'s songs praising the power of rock\'n\'roll, it does not come off that way. This is because Clinton never deals in the shameless machismo that made and makes AC/DC so annoying, nor is he as stridently preachy and instead comes across as intimately calling people to join him.Despite its title, ""Mothership Connection"" lacks the overt femininity of contemporary masterpieces byCanorRoxy Music. The rhythms are much tighter, but there are still clear traces of the expressive melody seen to great advantage in the work of those above-mentioned bands. This prevents P-Funk ever moving toward the awful machismo of 1980s and 1990s rap. Moreover, the intensity of the rhythms on ""Mothership Connection"", especially on the opening track ""P-Funk (Wants To Get Funked Up)"" is very subtle: it takes time to appreciate how different this is from the dance music that populated commerical radio in the time of ""Mothership Connection"".The title track ""Mothership Connection (Star Child)"" fires continuously and features some stragely melodic vocal work on the famous line ""swing low, sweet chariot"" that really fits in with Clinton\'s remarkably well-executed conceptual aim. ""Unfunky UFO"" is quietly touching like the best music always should be, but never loses its fiery rhythmic drive or its feeling of joyful hope, whilst ""Handcuffs"" is the most beautiful song on the record and could almost be onAvalonif it were not for the big soul voice. Yet, the varied voices only add emotion and feeling to the song rather than make it annoying. ""Give Up The Funk (Tear The Roof Off The Sucker)"" is the most ""jam""-like song here, but it still has a rare capacity to lure a listener in with repeated listens owing to the varied tone of the vocals and the repetitive, almost mantra-like lyrics. The music is actually very soft and its resonance and the chant near the end of the song fits its mood wonderfull well.All in all, ""Mothership Connection"" is a rare work of subtle intensity that is actually quite beautiful, whist at the same time being arguably the best ""concept"" album made this side ofHounds of Love.

He was from a Jewish family in pre-Quiet Revolution Montreal, and had been a published poet for over a decade before actually recording songs. The result is that his vocals were never trained and Cohen had a reputation as one of rock\'s first ""non-singers"".The effect of being in his thirties, however, was that Cohen was able to take a very different attitude towards the cultural changes that were taking place in the late 1960s - one which unlike Bob Dylan or Joni Mitchell placed him well out of the mainstream and meant that only his first two albums ever dented the Top 100 on Billboard. (In Europe, where Cohen was viewed as a romantic, he had such a large following that he managed to chart on a regular basis into the 1990s). Whereas Dylan and Mitchell had a rock orientation in their focus on the steel-string guitar, Cohen generally used a nylon-string guitar and a spartan string orchestra to accompany his vocals. The results can only be described as surprising in their simple beauty, and even as catchy.The opener ""Suzanne"" (which I confused for a long time with a song bythe Holliessets the tone with simple, almost classical poetry that has remarkable delicacy to it. Cohen\'s often-criticised voice was for me not a hard taste to acquire: indeed I found quite easily the reason it fits what he wrote so well. The following track ""Master Song"" is a mini-epic of the relationship between people that can be described as very conservative (did John J. Miller miss this one?) yet it is so tender that it can make one cry. ""Winter Lady"", ""The Stranger Song"" and ""Sisters of Mercy"" follow on this beauty, but on the second side of the original vinyl Cohen, if anything, take the same formula even further.""So Long, Marianne"" is an epic in the same way as ""Master Song"" but its moving tale of love surpasses it for darkness as well as for emotion, and then ""Hey, That\'s No Way to Say Goodbye"" takes one into the slow depths of recognising failure in a way people during the late 1960s had little inclination to do. Cohen, no doubt, tells genuine truth about how many people of the Boom Generation failed to form long-lasting relationships, and the three remaining songs on the second side of ""Songs of Leonard Cohen"", if more upbeat, show just how wise Cohen seems with hindsight.All in all, among the male singer/songwriters of the late 1960s and early 1970s no statement more definitive than ""Songs of Leonard Cohen"" exists.Moondancewould be its closest rival, but for all its nature-based mystical passion it is scarcely so wise or compassionate as Cohen\'s superb debut.

In accordance with this, she mellows out a great deal when compared withNew York Tendaberry- in contrast to her raucous piano playing of that album, here she plays with a deceptively soft, almost precious tone that would forsee Tori Amos by a quarter of a century. This is evident of the epic ""Map To The Treasure"", where she describes an epic tale of finding a lonely woman described as ""the treasure of love"". ""Brown Earth"" is another masterpiece, but this time moving towards the poppy sound ofEli And The Thirteenth Confession. ""Blackpatch"" is the most purely funk-oriented song on the album, and showcases Nyro\'s angelic voice at its best. ""Been On A Train"" and ""Up On The Roof"" are beautiful and ballad-like in tone, and their lush sound was to influence many later white-soul musicians.The intro to ""Beads Of Sweat"" describes the desolate environment of the spiritual seeker with a beauty it would take Jane Siberry to match (""I pricked my fingers on the thorns"" is actually a real description of Native American mystical rites), and then the song turns into a funky rhythm faintly echoing mid-80s Prince.The final track ""Christmas In My Soul"" is a soulful (almost gospel influence) piano-based ballad with a spiritual sense that would forsee the way forHounds Of Love, as Nyro gives a beautiful call for peace, aided by her slowest piano playing, which makes this track very difficult to appreciate, especially when it slows down after the intro section. Yet Nyro never loses her passion for a completely new type of social and spiritual vision, always calling for love and understanding - check out the line ""you\'ve got no guts, no gospel"", which is honestly quite scary.The sophistication and subtlety of Laura Nyro, and her influence on much pop-oriented music in the 70s and 80s, has led many critics to dimiss Laura Nyro - Robert Christgau once referred to her as a ""fool"". Yet, listening today toUnder The PinkorMaria, one can see that Laura Nyro was in fact a highly influential artist - her independence and spiritual musings were what paved the way for the modern-day female singer/songwriter to emerge. Without ""Christmas And The Beads Of Sweat"", it is hard to imagine how Kate Bush could have developed the mysticism so evident onHounds Of Love.All in all, whilstNew York Tendaberryis recommended as an introduction to Laura Nyro, if you love that album (recommended to all serious music lovers) you should try this one, even though it does take more listens to appreciate.It is an illustration of the way in which Nyro\'s complex, interpesonal narratives have been discredited by the punk-and-grunge admiring rock crit establishment that Laura Nyro does not have a single ""Essential Recording By Year"" or her own ""Essential Recordings"" on [...].

Laura Nyro, however, wanted to pay tribute to her soul roots after running out of her own songs to record after the wonderful, but quiet and consequently very challengingChristmas And The Beads Of Sweatthe previous year.The result was ""Gonna Take A Miracle"", an album of covers from the Motown and Brill Building soul eras recorded with vocal group LaBelle (Patti LaBelle, Nona Hendyx and Sarah Dash). In general, the huge hooks and frantic tempo changes ofNew York Tendaberrycould never be seen here, nor can the amazingly soft delicacy ofChristmas And The Beads Of Sweat. Instead, the tone was impressionistic in nature yet still intense and leaving one with a sense of amazement, especially in the power of the vocals in the magical medley ""Monkey Time/Dancing In The Street"" and ""Jimmy Mack"", where Nyro\'s superb vocal was truely breathtaking.The impressionistic tone and the absence of Nyro\'s own hyperfeminine lyrical style makes ""Gonna Take A Miracle"" the most palatable Nyro for the non-cultist (as can be clearly seen in many album guides). Yet, its impressionistic tone was also out of place with the development of heavy metal that was taking place at the time ""Gonna Take A Miracle"" came out. At the same time, the tone managed to retain the sheer brilliance ofNew York TendaberryandChristmas And The Beads Of Sweatand does not go back to the rather thinFirst Songs.The beautiful, atmospheric ballad ""The Wind"" contained the only traces of the extraordinary softness ofChristmas And The Beads Of Sweat, and ""Desiree"", though more accessible, was equally beautiful. Apart from the a capella opener ""I Met Him On A Sunday"", the rest of ""Gonna Take A Miracle"" was the most accessible work Nyro ever did, consisting of upbeat, joyful soul-pop songs such as ""Nowhere To Run"" (where LaBelle themselves take on lead vocals) and ""You\'ve Really Got A Hold On Me"". Generally Nyro\'s piano was not nearly so prominent as on her previous three albums of original material, but she still showed her skill in the sparse playing of ""The Wind"" and ""Spanish Harlem"" (which was the origin of one of her line in the amazing ""Map To The Treasure"" off her previous album).LaBelle themselves added superb harmony vocals throughout the album and managed to match Nyro\'s angelic voice throughout without missing a beat - surprising since the album was recorded from first takes due to shortage of time - though Nyro did tour extensively to support it before retiring for several years.The impressionism and vocal stylings of ""Gonna Take A Miracle"" were an inspiration in later years for such artists as the Roches and even recalls ESG\'s wonderfulA South Bronx Story. Nonetheless, despite not selling as well as its accessibility suggests it ought to have (perhaps due to the fact that a covers\' album was too novel for many back in 1972), ""Gonna Take A Miracle"" remains a good introduction to Nyro for the uninitiated - if one cannot handle this, one would have no hope of getting through Nyro\'s albums of original material with their complex, hyperfeminine lyrical style.', 'overall': 5.0, 'summary': 'Magical again, and most palatable Nyro for an outsider', 'unixReviewTime': 1038441600, 'reviewTime': '11 28, 2002'}","{'reviewerID': 'AKNSC7IXWEYLA', 'asin': 'B000002562', 'reviewerName': 'mianfei', 'helpful': [6, 8], 'reviewText': '""Smile"", released after a five-year hiatus, was the late Laura Nyro\'s last album to even remotely sell, and her first after moving to Danbury in rural Connecticut afterGonna Take A Miracle.The intervening years clearly took their toll on Nyro\'s ability to produce virtuosic piano workouts, and most of ""Smile"" was much simpler than the wonderfulEli And The Thirteenth Confession,New York TendaberryandChristmas And The Beads Of Sweat, all of which showed Laura Nyro to be an incredibly talented performer capable of extraordinarily difficult tempo, volume and chord changes put together seamlessly and logically.Nonetheless, ""Smile"" continued the softening of sound evident on the difficultChristmas And The Beads Of Sweat, though the sound lacked the unique delicacy and dreaminess of that album and was generally slow and melancholy - indeed tearful. The opener, a cover of ""Sexy Mama"", announced this with its folksy guitar intro and jazzy melodies.""Children Of The Junks"" was an excellent song that, though not different from ""Sexy Mama"" in musical tone, showed that Nyro\'s unique combination of sheer literacy and harsh realism in her lyrics had not deserted her (it stood almost as a far more accessible version of ""Been On A Train""). ""Money"" upped the tone somewhat with a funky groove akin to ""Beads Of Sweat"" and Nyro\'s hatred of playing the game of commercialism (""I feel like a pawn in my own world"") and her distate for environmental distraction (the brilliant ""in the city machines/where industries/fill the fish full of mercury"").""I Am The Blues"" was a very sad yet fairly accessible song in which Nyro told a brilliant tale of being lonely, aided by some superb poetry (""maybe Mars has good news"" and ""in a world of war/I can\'t find my laughter""), whilst ""Stormy Love"" was a simple yet hooky song, possibly the most immediate original song Nyro recorded - the vocal was superb and passionate. ""The Cat Song"" was the most playful track on the album, and showed Nyro\'s affection for animals (a prominent theme in her later life) in the way she imagined herself to be a cat.However, the last two songs were disappointing by Nyro\'s standards, and prevented ""Smile"" from being any masterpiece.Not in the class ofNew York TendaberryorChristmas And The Beads Of Sweat, but an impressive work nonetheless.', 'overall': 4.0, 'summary': 'Lacked the sheer wonderment, but excellent nonetheless', 'unixReviewTime': 1037923200, 'reviewTime': '11 22, 2002'}","{'reviewerID': 'AKNSC7IXWEYLA', 'asin': 'B000002564', 'reviewerName': 'mianfei', 'helpful': [0, 35], 'reviewText': 'Boz Scaggs, who had been in the music business for a long time and even made a record with Duane Allman in the 1960s, had recorded some fairly unsuccessful solo albums during the early part of the 1970s before ""Silk Degrees"" make him into a pop superstar.Today, there is relatively little criticism of middle-of-the-road music from the 1970s vis-&agrave;-vis what came out of the 1980s, presumably because the production is not generally so dated or because it is seen as having fewer associations with ""rock"".

More than that, the ultra-catchy choruses of all the slower songs on ""Silk Degrees"" stick with a listener in the worst kind of way - especially I will say for a person like myself who tends to have very unhealthy obsessions.

Stewartand Barbara Gaskin\'s remake ofLesley Gore\'s ""It\'s My Party"". ""O Superman"" also was a top thirty hit in Australia, and as a result Laurie Anderson was able to establish herself in the musical field despite the fact that many critics recognised that she was never truly ""musical"" in character and remained chiefly a performance artist all along.It is true that being a performance artist is not necessarily opposed to the making of music at its best. Kate Bush and George Clinton, for instance, have shown the ability to produce theatrical works that had some amazing musical talent onHounds of LoveandMothership Connection. However, even with Bush, there existed a tendency for mer music to improve when she focused more deeply on it rather than on the visual aspects as she did in her earliest days as a performer. The tendency is further supported by Laurie Anderson\'s musical career, and plagues ""Big Science"" throughout. There are many problems with the record, not least of which being that, apart from ""O Superman"" itself, there is hardly a single memorable hook line at any point on the record. Even the whispered hook of ""O Superman"" does not have the impact one would expect from an arty female singer/songwriter, whilst ""Walking and Falling"" really shows the lack of musicality on the album, being in fact not so different from the dated spoken passages that one hears on popular songs from the era. ""Born Never Asked"", though longer, has also aged very badly with the electronic drums being so much a staple of 1980s pop music, even if the production is so sparse it is easy to think otherwise without the clue provided by the strings.The music on tracks like ""Walking and Falling"" and ""Let X=X"" suffers equally badly from the dated and even syrupy synthesised strings, percussion and vocoders.

That song definitely does predate the horrible techno music, which came to be a prominent part of the charts in the middle 1990s, but features an impressive, single-note trumpet line that ties the piece together in a way Anderson never manages at any other point on ""Big Science"", creating a sound that is close to funk but avoids the potential stereotypes of that genre.There are a number of great female artists who managed to take the pioneering work of the first generation of female singer/songwriters into the 1980s and beyond, such as Kate Bush, the Cocteau Twins, Dead Can Dance and Kristin Hersh.

Fagen and Becker, through their ability to build complicated, yet seamless tales through brilliant, yet often truly satirical wordplay, moved far beyond the 1960s counterculture.The opening track ""Do It Again"" is one of the finest openers to any album and it is incredible ""Rolling Stone"" did not include it in their ""500 Greatest Songs of All Time"": in fairness, ""Do It Again"" should have been in the top fifty. The manner in which the cryptically dark lyrics about dramatic failures of people\'s plans are delivered in so light a way is one aspect of the song\'s staying power, but the sitar-and-percussion-driven jam and the energetic solo is another side. (The chorus line reminds me of former champion rugby fullback Garry Jack, and makes me wonder why the song never cropped up at sporting promotions).The rest of ""Can\'t Buy A Thrill"", whilst not matching the amazing opener, is still impressive. The wordplay in ""Kings"" will evoke the deepest memories of school history lessons with the ""good King Richard"" and ""good King John""s, whilst ""Dirty Work"", if less energetic, is darkly beautiful and shows David Palmer - often derided - actually had a quite impressive voice. The second verse with its resigning, yet touching lyrics is enough to make the song worthwhile, as is the powerful and deep saxophone line before the last chorus.""Change of the Guard"" has a wonderful guitar solo and playing that rivals ""Do It Again"", whilst the trademark piano on ""Fire In The Hole"" is really creepy and backed up by some lyrics that are closer to true poetry that Fagan was to be in later years. ""Reeling In The Years"" might be a little overplayed (compared to ""Do It Again) but still possesses great truth in the way it showed the 1960s well and truly over, whilst the guitar break still sounds fresh and fiery thirty-five years after it was recorded. Finally, ""Midnite Cruiser"" really shows the plight of a ""terrible loser"" with evocative beauty.Few artists have ever made such a good debut as ""Can\'t Buy A Thrill"", and Steely Dan showed their talent by producing five superb albums up to 1976. Whilst the cerebral lyrics - which really will have any attuned listener thinking about the fate of the ""losers"" depicted so often within them - capture most attention, the playing is perfectly done and often truly passionate, and Gary Katz\' production is very un-dated compared to most recordings from the 1970s.', 'overall': 5.0, 'summary': 'Back, Garry, and bring it back again', 'unixReviewTime': 1199318400, 'reviewTime': '01 3, 2008'}","{'reviewerID': 'AKNSC7IXWEYLA', 'asin': 'B000002PD8', 'reviewerName': 'mianfei', 'helpful': [4, 5], 'reviewText': '1976\'s ""The Royal Scam"" is an often-overlooked part of the Steey Dan canon, falling between the critically acclaimedPretzel LogicandAja, which made them superstars and saw them developing their already-noted studio perfectionism to levels that are best described as overdone.The cover of ""The Royal Scam"" can be likened to a horror movie without the blood, and the allosaur-like heads attacking the man is undoubtedly repellant at first but actually it fits the music quite well.The album\'s best-known song, ""Haitian Divorce"", showed just how funny and lighthearted the Dan could be, yet the song\'s joyful tone does not override the fact that it is really as much about misfits as most Dan songs were. It is remarkably catchy, too. The rest of ""The Royal Scam"", however, is the darkest work Steely dan ever produced and unsurprisingly has seldom been played on the radio. The opener ""Kid Charlemagne"" is intense in a remarkably quiet manner that onyl makes it more memorable, whilst ""The Caves of Altamira"" is a remarkably touching meditation upon humanity\'s origins that manages to be a true critique of today\'s hectic culture. The music, too, is at times truly beautiful. ""The Fez"" looks in a similar manner at less advanced cultures: it has a spiritual tone but not in the way ""Bodhisattva"" and ""Time Out Of Mind"" did.""Green Earrings"" manages to be seemingly both static and moving at once, yet the directness, even frankness, of Fagen\'s message is multiplied by his unusual and off-key single-word lines throughout the song. Many of the beats actually hit harder than Parliament or Stevie Wonder at their funkiest - an achievement in itself. The closing title tune, which follows a somewhat similar pattern of staccato single notes, is even better. The lyrics about the problems of Puerto Rican immigrants are some of the best Fagen ever wrote, and the way the short guitar solo breaks out of the song\'s stateliness is more passionate than anything in the Steely Dan canon.All in all, ""The Royal Scam"" is the darkest album Steely Dan ever made and its off-key (though still accessible) song structures fit perfectly with possibly Fagen\'s best lyrics ever.

""The Millions You Never Made"" does stand as the clearest example of the change coming her over Ani DiFranco\'s music, but even ""Crime for Crime"" and the rather lame title track show that she lost a lot of the crisp funkiness that made her first six albums so good.It is true that, on comparison with her dated and often pompous late 1990s work that made her into a significant seller on the album market, ""Not a Pretty Girl"" does contain some moments that show her, like on ""Out of Range"", expanding her early sound without losing anything. The fierce third track ""Cradle and All"" has a particularly impressive opening that rings even more powerfully than ""Out of Range"", and ""Shy"" is not far behind. The slower tunes, however, lack equally the sheer power and starkness one would expect after listening to her first few albums.All in all, even with some good songs on it, ""Not a Pretty Girl"" is the beginning of the end for Ani DiFranco as one of the outstanding talents of the 1990s.

Instead of the sharp, stark, yet often beautiful sound of her first five albums, ""Dilate"" too often sounds just like the overblown posturing ofAlanis Morrisette. Even self-producing, Ani does not give the record the stark sound she once did, and on the harder songs such as ""Outta Me, Onto You"" and ""Napoleon"" she does not really come across as honest to her aims of being an independent musician because she seems to be going to close to typical middle 1990s rock.

Such songs as ""Gaucho"" itself, which tries far too hard to be humorous and ""Third World Man"" are quite emotionless and much too light for a band that once put out pieces like ""Bodhissatva"", ""Do It Again"", ""Change of the Guard"" or ""The Royal Scam"". The ""Bodhissatva"" sequel, ""Time Out of Mind"", with Dire Straits\' Mark Knopfler guesting on guitar, has lyrics that impress in spite of being almost overtly religious (I admit I never saw that when I first listened) but the music, in spite of a clear, dense vocal from Fagen, could have sounded much better were the production crisper and more intense. The opener ""Babylon Sisters"", whose chorus should have rocked quite hard, suffers from the same problem and the song becomes less than exciting after years of listening.Nonetheless, ""Gaucho"" does contain two absolutely classic Steely Dan tracks that save it from being a waste of time. ""Hey Nineteen"" is pure funk with a wonderful lyric about the dreams of youth back in the late 1960s - and it has the same crispness and power the Dan produced time and time again on their first five albums. ""Glamour Profession"", a brilliantly-weaved tale of the underground criminal life of a professional basketballer, on the other hand uses the light production to create a psychedelic atmosphere that is truly hypnotic yet catchy. It is a pity the Dan were unable to replicate this sense of atmosphere more often on their last two albums before the breakup. When they try on the chorus of ""My Rival"", however, it shows how difficult creating one song like ""Glamour Profession"" actually is.All in all, despite two excellent songs, ""Gaucho"" is a rather disappointing farewell considering what the Dan did on their first five albums.

""Tell Her About It"" and ""Leave A Tender Moment Alone"" were also flyweight in texture and had not a single memorable hook line or melody. Even the soulful ""Tell Her About It"" was redeemed only by its extreme catchiness, but catchiness is something to be expected from a singer who was the most popular musician in Australia for fifteen years.

This change of tone is illustrated right from the opening track ""Rikki Don\'t Lost That Number"", which became their only hit on the Australian singles charts, and is a relatively straightforward piano ballad that lacks the amazing story-in-song character of their best work. However, with the second track ""Night By Night"", the Dan show that they can transform the slow-burn psychedelia of ""Show Biz Kids"" from their previous album onto pure pop. The precise, staccato horn riff is totally memorable, as are the lyrics. The slower ""Barrytown"" carries on from this with a beauty that is genuinely sly, as does the more familiar of never-played-on-radio ""Any Major Dude Will Tell You"".

From tales of ecological devastation to immigrant lives, Fagen\'s lyrics were much better than anyone in rock at the time and have rarely been equalled (Paddy McAloon of Prefab Sprout and Tori Amos on her first two albums come close).After the masterfulThe Royal Scam, Steely Dan became even more of a studio band than before with ""Aja"". The story of how the band\'s notorious perfectionism led to songs being given tens of takes to complete is well-known, but the trouble is that whereas this perfectionist style made for music that expressed the feelings of their lyrics remarkably well on previous releases, on ""Aja"" it is fair to say the Dan took it beyond anything reasonable. As so often in the early days of overlayering, it serves merely to reduce the emotional level of the music.""Black Cow"", the opening track, is very catchy but does not really match previous openers like ""Black Friday"" or ""Do It Again"" despite the band trying quite wholeheartedly to be more pretty than they were meant to be.

The romantic pieces on the second side, especially the touchingly beautiful ""Blame It on the Sun"", do make up for this to a considerable extent.

Bands like andTelevisionandTuxedomoonwere able to move beyond the mechanical formula of short, loud and fast songs to create music whose freedom and spontaneity still resonates today. Another legacy of the ""punk revolution"" that has had some noteworthy consequences is the emergence of all-female or mainly female groups playing their own instruments. Whilst in many cases this has led to situations where women try to sing with a violently angry tone which, as the brilliant writer ""janitor-x"" once said, is always awkward, in other cases it has allowed for the making of spontaneous, free-flowing music that moves far beyond the overblown character of so much rock music of the period and since.The Slits are the perfect example of this contradiction. Intheir early careerthey were a generic punk band only played by girls, but their passion to make music drove them here to much greater deeds. Instead of simply playing generic rock and roll, on ""Cut"" the Slits devise a totally different sound of jerky, though not dense rhythms and a vocal style that benefits greatly by being so untrained.

Nonetheless, the song really is so touching, just like a folk hymn.""Spanish Harlem"" and ""Save The Country"" do not have a radically different mood from their studio equivalents, but the numerous medleys, though none are as good as ""Monkey Time""/""Dancing In The Street"", offer a great insight into the way Nyro performed hers and others songs on stage - none of them sound in any way disjointed because she flawlessly joins the songs.A most impressive document, showing Nyro\'s ability to vary mood and style in its absolute peak.', 'overall': 5.0, 'summary': 'Worthy addition to a Nyro library', 'unixReviewTime': 1089504000, 'reviewTime': '07 11, 2004'}","{'reviewerID': 'AKNSC7IXWEYLA', 'asin': 'B000KSPB92', 'reviewerName': 'mianfei', 'helpful': [5, 5], 'reviewText': 'In 1978, the expressive, dramatic, feminine stylings of Laura Nyro were completely out of fashion in favour of the macho, worldly simplicity of the ""punk revolution"" and the overblown pomposity of a stiflingly restrictive commercial radio network. The utter commercial failure of ""Nested"" is thus no surprise, but what is surprising is how well Laura Nyro manages to sound on this recording.Even though ""Nested"" cannot be said to have the sense of wonder ofEli,TendaberryorChristmas, it more than makes up for this with its beautifully melodic soundscapes that are for the most part an improvement on her previous studio album ""Smile"". The opening track ""Mr. Blue"" is very sad and takes time to get used to, but its beauty is undeniable, whilst the following two pieces ""Rhythm and Blues"" and ""My Innocence"" are highlights of the record. with a bouncy rhythm and thoroughly emotional vocals, these longs express Laura\'s joy at having at least personally survived despite the loss of her mother. ""My Innocence"" is particularly impressive with its barbed-wire guitar outro that almost reminds one of Funkadelic. The next three tracks are much darker, especially ""American Dreamer"" with its attack on business corruption making it the most political song Laura ever wrote.""The Sweet Sky"", however, is the standout track here, a beautiful celebration of the power of music driven by the unique drumming style of Andy Newmark, later to play on Roxy\'s landmarkAvalon. The finale to this song is as powerful as anything in the Nyro canon and Michele Kort was undoubtedly right presenting it during her audio documentary of Soul Picnic. ""Light"" and closer ""The Nest"" are just so touchingly beautiful, whilst ""Child in a Universe"", a celebration of Laura\'s new son, is a cosmically powerful piece that grows on a listener extremely well.All in all, even if there was no place to market it, ""Nested"" still stands up very well amongst an impressive canon. Strongly recommended to all fans of female singer/songwriters with its beautiful feminine tone, some impressive lyrics and Andy Newmark\'s singular drumming.', 'overall': 5.0, 'summary': 'The maturation that nobody heard of a wonderful talent', 'unixReviewTime': 1240617600, 'reviewTime': '04 25, 2009'}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

E-40 is from Vallejo, and after dropping this album he proved he had everything it took to be the next West Coast rap star.  His crazy, comical, hip style is a pleasure to listen to.  Also, the beats on this album are some of the best I've heard in a while.  They have a richness to them, which is real good.  Production comes from very accomplished producers like Sam Bostic and Mike Mosely, Studio Tone (who produced some tracks for Kurupt), Funk Daddy, and a few others.  Also, E-40 raps extremely fast on some tracks, and it took me a couple listens to get it when I first started listening to him a long time ago.  However, after a listen, everything sounds clear as a bell!  He's also got an amazing guest list: Tupac, Suga T, Mac Mall, Spice 1, B-Legit, Mac-Shawn, and Celly Cel to name a few.  But most of the tracks have E-40 going solo, which is good too, because it's good to see he's not just relying on others to guest on his album.  Overall the tracks sound &quot;Hipper than a hippopotamous&quot;.The album starts off with this introduction over a slower beat, but then moves into the crazy funked out &quot;The Bumble&quot;.  E-40 rips this track to shreds, and the beat is bananas!  Definitely one of the most original beats I've heard in a while.  &quot;Sideways&quot; also has a tight bouncy beat, and E-40 and B-Legit trade lines on it with class.  Mac-Shawn does the chorus, clever lyricism on here too.  &quot;Spittin'&quot; has a heavy, sunny funk beat.  E-40 comes with a real nice intro at the beginning, but sounds nice throughout.  &quot;Sprinkle Me&quot; is a classic single, with a fun, sunny beat and Suga T (E-40's sister) guests on it.  They make a nice sibling team.  Sprinkle me mayne!  &quot;Dusted And Disgusted&quot; like everyone else says, is a CLASSIC posse cut.  It features Tupac, Spice 1 and Mac Mall.  The way the beat changes is so dope.  E-40 holds his own against three other great emcees.  Part of the beat is a nice, laid-back one, and the other is a rough gangsta beat.  &quot;One Love&quot; is a nice light-hearted track where 40 gets personal.  Great line: &quot;This ain't no happy Shirley Temple talleistic crap/This here is serious, more realistic than radio-shack&quot;.  Actually sounds like it could've been a huge hit even today.  &quot;Smoke And Drink&quot; has more of a Zapp sound to it.  E-40 raps really fast on it, but nicely, and the beat has this cool groove to it, and I love the refrain!  &quot;They Ain't Know&quot; is a slower song about street life and gettin' money.  The lyrics are worth listening to.  &quot;Fed&quot; has a GREAT bouncing bass beat, and E-40 rips it, the tune sounds kind of familiar from something else, it's catchy.  &quot;H-i-Double-L&quot; is a classic ode to Vallejo featuring B-Legit and Celly Cel who both tear it up along with 40.  The beat is nice and sounds like the kind of thing for the car.  &quot;Bootsee&quot; is a tight funky track about a busta named &quot;Bootsee&quot;.  I'm sure you're familiar with someone in real life who fakes and claims to be tough when they're really just fakin' it.  &quot;It's All Bad&quot; is a darker track where 40 speaks on various subjects in life.  He knows the game well.Overall if you like Bay Area rap, you probably have this, but if you don't try it.  E-40 tears it up everytime he's on the mic on this record, and the beats are amazing."", 'overall': 5.0, 'summary': 'Sun-splashed Bay Area rap classic!

While it might not have been on the level of The Chronic, Doggystyle or Kurupt and Daz\'s Dogg Food, it\'s still a good album and doesn\'t deserve to be trashed.  The main change of the album is that Snoop\'s voice is a little bit lower which makes his style a bit different.  You can\'t really help that your voice changes over time (although some may say Snoop\'s voice lowered because of marijuana use).  The beats aren\'t done by Dr. Dre because he had left Death Row by now, although Soopafly, Daz and DJ Pooh do a very nice job of making up for his absence.  Snoop is a much more mature person on this release, he isn\'t the same guy who laughed in the face of death and wore an afro like the Snoop of 1992-1996.  However, he still manages to make something that balances gangsta rap very well.  The beats are actually pretty good, a bit different than Dre\'s but they mesh pretty well with Snoop\'s style.  Snoop had also just been declared innocent over his murder trial when his bodyguard was forced to kill a man who was coming at them with a gun and bad intentions.The intro actually takes on the accusations Snoop was given when he was on trial and moves into the Italian-influenced title track which was produced by Daz.  Snoop raps in a laid-back feel and has a Mafioso persona.  ""Up Jump Tha Boogie"" features Kurupt and blue-eyed soul singer Teena Marie for a nice, bouncy G-Funk track courtesy of DJ Pooh.  Snoop and Kurupt both spit nicely here.  ""Freestyle Conversation"" is kind of a weak track where Snoop takes a shot at Dr. Dre and spits about people accusing him.  He whispers which doesn\'t work for him because his flow is soft enough when he speaks.  ""Snoop Bounce"" has a Zapp influence and is a decent slice of funk, vocoder and all.  Snoop sounds a little bit out of it on this song though.  ""Gold Rush"" has the cowboy theme to it similar to The Juice Crew\'s ""Symphony"".  Kurupt joins Snoop along with the LBC Crew and the track is actually very satisfying and nicely put together.  ""Me And My Doggz"" is a decent, bouncy little track with a lazy feel, nothing particularly special about it.  Snoop talks about which dogs he gave to his homies.  ""You Thought"" is very tight, a pimpalistic track featuring Soopafly and Too Short where everyone gets a piece.  The three mesh together perfectly and this song works very well.  Snoop did a remake of ""Vapors"" by Biz Markie in contrast to his remake of Slick Rick\'s ""Lodi Dodi"" on Doggystyle.  This remake is really good, and he gives shouts to Nate Dogg and Warren G in his verses.  ""Groupie"" is a quintessential sex track from the DPG, featuring Kurupt, Warren G, Nate, Daz and Charlie Wilson.  The track is very smooth and everyone spits good game.  ""2001"" is a bouncy track that Kurupt and Bad Azz helped write but the track isn\'t that great.  It\'s just an average song.  ""Six Minutes"" has an original feel and speaks on Snoop biters but the track doesn\'t really go anywhere and in the end is nothing special at all.  ""O.J. (Wake Up)"" is a pretty good track with an old school feel courtesy of a Run-DMC sample.  Tray D really connects on this track, and Snoop also spits some good stuff.  ""Snoop\'s Upside Ya Head"" is the album\'s first single and is an amazing track, really recalling the G-Funk era, and Snoop spits in the classic form we really have missed throughout this album.  ""Blueberry"" is a classic Dogg Pound track where Kurupt truly shines and the LBC Crew connect along with Daz.  Snoop doesn\'t even spit on this track but it recalls ""For All My N****z And B****es"" from Doggystyle.  The beat is classic Death Row material.  ""Doggyland"" is a slower track where Snoop raps in a lazy summer style.  The track really doesn\'t go anywhere, although Snoop talks about suffering a little bit.  ""Downtown Assassins"" features Daz and Kurupt for a Mafioso style song which is a good track and ends the album pretty nicely.Overall this release is a good one.  However I can understand that after Doggystyle, Murder Was The Case and The Chronic someone may be disappointed.  There are just a few lazy tracks that stunt this album, although nothing about it is that bad.  It is majorly over-criticized.  If you\'re a fan of Snoop or G-Funk, check this one out.', 'overall': 4.0, 'summary': 'Good album, but still disappointed many.', 'unixReviewTime': 1032566400, 'reviewTime': '09 21, 2002'}","{'reviewerID': 'A1NX6JFDR8RDOC', 'asin': 'B0000024I7', 'reviewerName': 'Mister Hip-Hop', 'helpful': [3, 4], 'reviewText': 'This is one of the greatest G-Funk albums ever. Warren G shows here, on his debut album, that he is a hip-hop genius. The sunny summertime sounds of Long Beach rap are always amazing. All of the tracks are laced by soulful keyboards, thoughtful raps and beautiful bass. The songs are unreal and can be enjoyed over and over again. Warren G has the ability to appeal to all. All of the songs are extremely memorable, and I find it hard to believe that anyone couldn\'t enjoy this album. Listening to it soothes you; it makes one feel better. Almost like heaven on Earth, quite a masterpiece. Warren G is a complete hip-hop artist, with the ability to rap and produce amazingly well. This album has some of Warren G in his 213 days, and in my mind Warren continues to bring the West Coast to the top. All of the lyrics are intelligent, no mindless killing songs, no stupid sex stories, and best of all, no dumb interludes. Instead, the two interludes are hilarious plays on other things, ""Gangsta Sermon"", a sermon turned gangsta with a preacher talking about chronic, and my favorite interlude, ""1994 Draft"", which turns the NBA Draft on its ear to a woman draft. The best things about this album are the bright sounds and raps.The highlights on this album include the classic ""Regulate"", the first single, in which Warren G and Nate Dogg trade lines, making a magnificent team. This is in my mind the most innovative track in all of hip-hop. On ""Do You See"", there are icy keyboards and great raps by Warren G, excellent lyrics about his life and the way it has progressed. On ""Recognize"", a great Long Beach track, Warren joins The Twinz, a group on his very own label, and they bring in some excellent raps. Warren comes off very well on this track himself, and the keyboards and guitar are great. On ""Super Soul Sis"", Warren joins special guest Jah Skills, a female rapper from the group Five Footaz, for a light-hearted spinning song that works brilliantly. ""So Many Ways"" is a swinging tune that has Warren G turning in an excellent performance, and a great spanish chorus with sweet keyboards. My very favorite, the second single, ""This DJ"", is another track I really love, with its soulful keyboards and feeling, is Warren G at his best. Yet another one of my favorites is ""This Is The Shack"", a blissfully swinging, shuffle-beat track featuring The Dove Shack, who all really kick nice raps over a sweet keyboard and funky guitar. Another classic is ""And You Don\'t Stop"", laced by guitar somewhat like the background music of Warren\'s newer track ""Dope Beat"", and Warren\'s lively raps. Last is the lyrically amazing track, ""Running With No Breaks"", another track I love, and I can enjoy all of the tracks, they are all amazing.To conclude this review, I can enjoy all of the tracks on this classic album. Any hip-hop fan will appreciate this, but it\'s great even if you like Soul/R&B;, Jazz, Blues, anything, this is a great find.

This fun and interesting album has it all: bouncing party beats, the thoughtful lyrics, and that great G-Funk style and flavor. The songs are all touched with sun-soaked keyboards, and most notably the great guitar in many of the songs. The innovative styles and rapping on this album are breezy and laid-back, which is definitely Warren\'s style. In my mind, he is the true originator of G-Funk production, not Dr. Dre or Big Hutch, and Daz Dillinger would be G-Funk\'s greatest innovator. Warren also is a great rapper, his lyrics are comical and thoughtful at the same time. This was Warren\'s first album to be released on his new label, G-Funk Recordings, and this album has excellent guests as well. Nate Dogg, Ron Isley, Jayo Felony, Mr. Malik, The Five Footaz, The Twinz, Reel Tight, and Erick Sermon, plus many others. These guests fit well with Warren\'s beautiful beats.Highlights on this album include ""Annie Mae"", a great duet with Nate Dogg, which will remind many of Warren\'s hit ""Regulate"", because it once again has Warren and Nate trading lines. This time though, it\'s about a girl named Annie Mae, and Warren and Nate compliment each other well here. The second single ""Smoking Me Out"", features Ron Isley singing the hook for a bouncy party track. Warren puts in a very nice rap, as well as on the excellent ""Reality"", a laid-back track celebrating a sunset gangsta scene. On ""Young Fun"", Jayo Felony and Knee-Hi join Warren for a funky gangsta track about life as a kid. Even though the promotional version of ""What We Go Through"" features Kurupt and Daz Dillinger and was taken off of the album, the new one is an excellent track, featuring Bad A$$, Mr. Malik and Technique (who is listed on the album as Perfect) for a pretty piano-laced track. On this song, Warren disses LL Cool J, really tearing him up. Many have wondered why Warren did diss LL, and it was because LL dissed Warren on his 1995 Mr. Smith LP. ""We Brings Heat"" is a nice track that features The Five Footaz and The Twinz, and is very good though Warren\'s beat sounds kind of like West Coast Mobb Deep (if one can picture that), it\'s still a great beat. ""Transformers"" is another nice keyboard-laced track, extremely nice laid-back track with a vocoder chorus. My favorite is ""Relax Your Mind"", which features Reel Tight singing the chorus, and a relaxing beat that really does clear your thoughts. ""To All DJ\'s"" is sure to get the party up, an extremely funky track with Mr. Malik. The first single ""I Shot The Sheriff"", is another one of the album\'s best, while the remix is included and done by Erick Sermon of EPMD, and the beat is a sample of ""Strictly Business"", performed by EPMD. On the European version, there is the bonus ""What\'s Love Got To Do With It"", and the song\'s remix. I have heard it and it\'s a great song, with cool guitars and lyrics. All of the tracks are good, ""Back Up"" is probably the album\'s worst, but it still is excellent.To conclude my review, I would recommend this if you like G-Funk. If you do, it\'s a must.', 'overall': 5.0, 'summary': 'Another great album from Warren G.', 'unixReviewTime': 1032566400, 'reviewTime': '09 21, 2002'}","{'reviewerID': 'A1NX6JFDR8RDOC', 'asin': 'B000002JN4', 'reviewerName': 'Mister Hip-Hop', 'helpful': [12, 12], 'reviewText': ""You have to love The D.O.C., he has amazing technical rapping skills, great energetic personality, and of course Dr. Dre's beats go perfectly with his style.  Originally from Texas, D.O.C. moved to Los Angeles and hooked up with the classic group N.W.A., on Ruthless Records.  Eazy-E handled executive production, and Dre was in his good old days and did a great job with the beats.  But D.O.C. still came amazing on every single song and also used very little profanity on this album which showed his versatility, especially considering that he was working with N.W.A., one of the most controversial rap groups of all-time.  It's such a shame the The D.O.C. lost his vocal cords in 1992 in a car crash and lost his mind-blowing flow.  But he continued rapping after that and he might not have had the same technical ability but he remained a great lyricist.  No One Can Do It Better was released in 1989 and still sounds fresh.  And of course you have to love the real live instruments playing on the songs, and the saxophone solos on a couple songs.  Even the commercial interludes have meaning, and are catchy.  An undisputed classic album.The album opens up with the signature track &quot;It's Funky Enough&quot;, which is a crazy song.  D.O.C. rips it here, and the beat is definitely funky enough from Dre.  A good party track, never gets tired.  &quot;Mind-Blowing&quot; has a nice piano and bass beat and D.O.C. comes with some of the best verses I've heard in a long time.  He switches rapping at fast and normal paces and it does blow the mind.  &quot;Lend Me An Ear&quot; is another swift track, with D.O.C. tearing a head-nodding beat into pieces.  The first commercial has Michel'le singing on it, and has these two people talking on it which is pretty funny.  &quot;Let The Bass Go&quot; is a funky, laid-back track with some excellent rapping by Doc again.  Good scratching by Dre as well.  &quot;Beautiful But Deadly&quot; is a rock type of track with an obvious Run-DMC influence and has great heavy-metal guitars.  The song is about a girl who is beautiful but deadly.  &quot;The D.O.C. And The Doctor&quot; is a perfect example of the relationship Dre and D.O.C. had musically.  D.O.C. raps real well and the beat is a funky Parliament portrait.  &quot;No One Can Do It Better&quot; certainly sounds like a hit, and has a great guitar beat.  D.O.C. also comes with some really good lyrics on this song.  &quot;Whirlwind Pyramid&quot; is a fast-paced party track with a instrumental that sounds like a James Brown track and of course D.O.C. is emceeing at his unbelieveable fast speed.  &quot;The Formula&quot; is one of The D.O.C.'s best songs ever.  It's more laid-back and Doc raps with a different feel.  The tune during the chorus is great and there's also a nice late night feel to this song.  &quot;Portrait Of A Masterpiece&quot; is also amazing.  D.O.C. raps faster than ever on this song and the beat is also amazingly fast.  It blew me away the first time I heard him do it.  &quot;The Grand Finale&quot; is the final song which features the whole N.W.A. group: Ice Cube, MC Ren, Eazy-E, Dr. Dre (who only talks and introduces everyone) and DJ Yella (who plays the drums).  They all tear this song to pieces over a nice gangsta beat.  One of the best songs on here; a classic.This whole album is classic.  Also, it's very influential and many other rappers have used similiar styles to The D.O.C., like DJ Quik, Crooked I, Xzibit, and plenty others.  Before Ruthless had funk, it was funky enough.  Also, has anyone here heard the song that was left off this album by The D.O.C. called &quot;Bridgette&quot;?  It was released on Dr. Dre's album Second Round Knock Out.  The song didn't make No One Can Do It Better but it's a nice bouncy track about a girl named Bridgette.  The song is touchy though, especially compared to this album which is very clean.  D.O.C. shouldn't have lost his vocal cords, I miss his old style and I'm sure many others do too.

His debut had a couple weaknesses but is mostly quite good.  The hit single &quot;Foe Life&quot; was an instant club hit, and was produced by Ice Cube with a funky saxophone loop and Mack 10 introducing himself to the world.  &quot;Wanted Dead&quot; is also a classic gangsta track with a late night sort of feel to it, and Mack 10 tears this song up.  &quot;On Them Things&quot; is kind of an abrasive track but sounds really good, and has the standard gangsta sound to it.  &quot;Chickenhawk&quot; is another tight track with booming bass and some funky vocals.  &quot;Here Comes The G&quot; is an absolute classic, with a nice, funky bounce and laid-back feel.  Mack also tore this song up.  &quot;Westside Slaughterhouse&quot; also is a classic, and features WC and Ice Cube, and Cube takes a shot at Common Sense to spark the beef they had (Common lyrically obliterated Ice Cube).  WC also had some of the coldest battle lines on this vicious track.  Also, there are some nice tracks like &quot;Armed And Dangerous&quot; which has a neighborhood, summertime feel to it, and &quot;Mozi-Wozi&quot; is a nice sex track, about a hotel with a nice, slow beat added to it.  &quot;Mack Ten's The Name&quot; is Mack 10 telling all fakes in the game that they better change their name to Mack 11 because Mack 10 is HIS name.  Also, Kay-Dee connects with Mack very nicely on &quot;H.O.E.K.&quot;, another good track about females.  There are a couple pointless interludes, and one extremely wack song in &quot;Ten Million Ways&quot; which has a repeatitive and boring beat and hook.  That lowers the overall rating but still this is a worthy and impressive debut.  Excellent production came from Ice Cube, Rhythm D, and others.This is definitely an album to buy if you like Mack 10, or even if you hate his new music, you have to give credit to this as a worthy listen.

Miles worked with Gil Evans on this 1949 project and the results were pure magic.  The supporting cast of musicians are a nice group too.  He even had french horn players (Junior Collins on one session, Sandy Goldstein on another and Gunther Schuller).  Most of the musicians Miles worked with on this album were white, because those were the only people he could get hired at the time.  Of these musicians, Gerry Mulligan (baritone saxophone), Lee Konitz (alto saxophone) and Kai Winding (trombone) all shine the most.  Tracks like ""Move"" showcase the band\'s chemistry and innovative, playful harmonies.  This song was originally recorded as a bebop tune, but Miles and company give it a little bit more of a cool, swinging style.  ""Jeru"" is the ultimate definition of cool jazz.  This Gerry Mulligan composition shows off Miles and Gerry\'s soloing abilities.  It also has a nice theme and some good ensemble playing.  ""Moon Dreams"" is kind of like a musical ""still life"", this ballad is played with a slow seriousness that makes it a classic.  The ensemble playing here is beautiful.  ""Venus De Milo"" is another Mulligan composition and has a somewhat laid-back latin feel.  I like this tune because it just sounds nice to sit back and listen to.  ""Budo"" is a classic Bud Powell tune, while this track only lasts about two and a half minutes, it\'s a classic instantly.  The ensemble playing is very energetic and Miles, Lee Konitz and Kai Winding all take great solos.  This tune was also recorded by Miles around the time of the \'Round About Midnight sessions.  ""Deception"" is a track that Miles is given credit for writing but it\'s really another track called ""Conception"", that Miles recorded later on in the Dig session of 1951.  It\'s a nice tune, with a kind of tension-building theme sequence, along with a nice solo from Miles.  ""Godchild"" has a great theme because all the lower instruments play it making it a fun, playful track.  Once again, Miles plays a nice solo and Kai Winding takes a good trombone solo as well.  ""Boplicity"" has credit given to Miles Davis\'s mom, although she didn\'t actually write the piece, Miles and Gil Evans did.  ""Boplicity"" is a masterful cool composition and has been recorded many times by other musicians.  Gerry Mulligan starts it off with a great sax solo and Miles leads in with the group and then playing a good solo.  Other tracks like ""Rocker"" and ""Israel"" were very influential in structure and composition, along with John Lewis\'s ""Rouge"", which has string bass played and is a very fun and amusing piece.  The album ends with the Kenny Hagood vocal feature ""Darn That Dream"", which is a slow piece that wasn\'t recorded until 1950 (along with a couple other tracks from the ""late"" sessions).  Hagood\'s vocal is cool, and Miles plays an outstanding solo in the middle of the piece.  The band backs the vocal very well ending the album nicely.This is a classic album, as everyone else has previously stated.

The album features jazzy, lively tracks that always seem to motivate and inspire. There are guest appearances on almost every single track, but instead of outshining Daz, they seem to complement him and make the album an even better treat. It also doesn\'t hurt that Daz is an amazing rapper himself. I would have to say that he is the best producer out there right now. Another great thing is that he picks great guests for the album. I\'m talking about Kurupt, Snoop Doggy Dogg, Tupac Shakur(R.I.P.), Tha Outlawz, Val ""Lady \'V\'"" Young, Bad Azz, Tray D, Nate Dogg, WC from Westside Connection, MC Eiht, and many, many more.The best thing about this album is that it has a lot to say. All of it shows lots of quality, time and effort were put into this album. All the tracks are really excellent, but the best track is by far ""Only For You"". It is a beautiful song with a great beat and great vocals from Val Young that almost remind me of Roberta Flack. Yet the best part of the song is when Daz tells the heart warming tale of how he meets a woman who is not a trick or a tramp and he falls in love with her. Another great track is ""It Might Sound Crazy"", which features Too Short. It is one of the better songs I\'ve heard this year. The beat is great and Daz Dillinger and Too Short are a memorable duo. Other highlights include the prophetic ""Thank God For My Life"", which features a few guests, ""Our Daily Bread"", a great track with a cool beat, not to mention guest appearances from Kurupt and a little speech from Prince Ital Joe, ""Initiated"", an amazing song that features Tupac Shakur, Tha Outlawz and Kurupt, the classic ""O.G."", where Daz raps with Nate Dogg and Snoop Doggy Dogg for a catchy and laid back trip on memory lane, the original ""Playa Partners"", a duet with B-Legit, ""In California"", a tribute to the sunshine state, ""Baby Mama Drama"", a song about how Daz\'s ex-girl is filing child support to get his money and support her and her current boyfriend, and ""Gang Bangin\' Ass Criminal"", a touchy title indeed, but is a great track where Daz joins Kurupt, Priest ""Soopafly"" Brooks, Tray D, Bad Azz, and Technique for a gently bouncing track that sounds sort of like Miles Davis\'s ""Spanish Key"".To conclude my review, I would definitely recommend this album to any rap fan, especially if you like the DPGs. Daz Dillinger is a truly talented rapper and producer and he really put this album together well. Another thing that really impressed me about this album is that not a single track out of this whole album is sampled, and instead, like on all of his produced cuts, he used real live instruments like keyboards, basses, guitars, and even the occaisional acoustic piano.

With Death Row\'s president Suge Knight getting in various troubles with the law, Nate was having trouble getting his album released. This two-disc set, having the first disc recorded in 1995 for Death Row Records and being released in 1996. The second disc is composed of material recorded in 1998 for Nate\'s currently defunct Dogg Foundation Records. The second disc is actually the better of the two, although the first disc is amazing. Nate Dogg, unlike almost any other in the rap category, sings in the smooth manner of a jazz or blues singer. In fact, a large portion of this album is very jazzy, and shows Nate\'s roots have always been the blues. His style is more original than anyone else\'s; he has a voice smoother than glass, and as he often says, you can tell he loves to sing. His smooth voice goes perfectly with the cool production from the likes of Daz Dillinger, Soopafly Priest, Warren G, and many others, including the unlikely production resources of Kurupt, Snoop Doggy Dogg, and even Nate himself, and great guests such as Kurupt, Snoop Doggy Dogg, Warren G, Daz Dillinger, Big Syke, Tupac Shakur, his sister Pamela Hale, and many more for this swinging album.The first disc has many highlights, including the Teddy Riley-produced ""The Hardest Man In Town"", which features another unlikely resource of production, considering Riley\'s forte is R&B; production, and he comes up with a beat that sounds like Daz or Dr. Dre. Nate\'s beautiful singing rounds the song. The funky ""G-Funk"" features Nate at his best, singing about what the greatest form of hip-hop means to him. ""First We Pray"" features Kurupt, and its soulful guitar beat and great lyrics make it classic Death Row material. The deep production of ""My World"" is amazingly interesting, and Nate\'s singing flows well over piano and guitars. ""Crazy, Dangerous"" is one of the greatest tracks on the album, produced by Johnny ""J"", who did tracks for Tupac. The soulful singing and guitar make this a must-listen. The second single, ""These Days"", is classic material with Daz Dillinger putting in a guest rap and Nate Dogg dissing B.G. Knocc Out & Dresta in his smooth ""I caught you slipping"" sort of laid-back GQ demeanor. ""Bag Of Weed"" is a comical track featuring Tray D, and a great, hypnotizing chorus. On another comical side, ""Dirty Hoe\'s Draws"", Nate joins DJ\'s and some other great singers including Butch Cassidy and Val Young for a slow jamming track you\'ll never forget. ""Scared Of Love"" is a jazzy track with a great trumpet and piano, plus Nate singing beautifully. Another classic is ""Me & My Homies"", which features Tupac Shakur, a classic friend song, with smooth keyboards and great lyrics. The swiftly-paced ""Because I Got A Girl"", is classic Nate Dogg, with its funky percussion-laced beat with keyboards and beautiful singing. The first single, ""Never Leave Me Alone"", is another classic song, produced by Kurupt, and featuring the playful rap of Snoop Doggy Dogg over a swinging beat. The prophetic ""Where Are You Going?"" is a slower song that really is great even though it drags out. This disc is great to listen to, especially if you love Death Row, but the second disc is even better.Highlighting tracks on the second disc include ""Dedication"", a short introduction to the album, where Nate disses Death Row\'s management, angry about the way he was treated there. ""Who\'s Playing Games?"" is a funky party track (everyone loves DPG in party mode), and ""I Don\'t Want To Hurt No More"" ticks like a clock with a great beat and Nate\'s heartfelt lyrics. ""Just Another Day"" is a funky Nate production, and filled with great singing. My favorite is ""She\'s Strange"", which is a piano and keyboard-laced swing track, featuring Barbara Wilson, who\'s sultry voice is perfect for the song. ""Almost In Love"" is also a pretty ballad, with a great concept of Nate almost falling in love with a lady until he finds out who she really is. ""No Matter Where I Go"", is a classic Nate Dogg track, filled with organs and lively instruments. ""Friends"" is a 213 reunion, with fellow members Snoop Doggy Dogg and Warren G, for a track about homeboys and a slower beat. ""Puppy Love"", on the other hand, is a party track which features Daz, Snoop Doggy Dogg and Kurupt for a party track. The third single, ""Nobody Does It Better"", is a classic single featuring Warren G, a perfect duet between the two, up there with the classics ""Regulate"" and ""Annie Mae"". Another winner is ""Sexy Girl"", which features keyboards and guitars, plus a great hook and a rap from Big Syke. ""Dogg Pound Gangstaville"", is a classic DPG track with a funky beat and Kurupt and Snoop Doggy Dogg coming in for an appearance. The last track is the great ""Never Too Late"", with it\'s trumpets and keyboards, a great blues track.To conclude my review, I would recommend this to anyone.

His lyrical depth and awareness is untouchable.  Put that together with some great, rugged beats and you have At The Speed Of Life.  Xzibit mainly clowns commercial rap which is fine with me.  But also he takes on subjects such as life, females, gangsta tales, and sometimes just flat out lyricism.  If you like Cash Money, do yourself a favor and don't buy this.  If you like REAL hip-hop, you'll love this.  The beats are dark, and the sound of this album is extremely East Coast.  Actually, if Xzibit and his homies weren't claiming Los Angeles on this album, some of the tracks may even sound East Coast in a way.  But it's still a classic from the intro to the outro.  Also, Xzibit's joined by a lot of his friends, such as Tash, J-Ro, Hurricane G, King T, and others.  The styles of beats range from classical loops, jazz tunes, and underground rappin' beats.  &quot;Gets you open like Nicole Brown Simpson&quot;.The first song on the album is the deep, &quot;At The Speed Of Life&quot;.  Here Xzibit basically introduces himself, and what you're going to hear on the album.  It has a heavy drum-beat, and a nice laid-back feel.  One of my favorites is &quot;Just Maintain&quot;.  This song features J-Ro and Hurricane G, and they rip up fake rappers.  The beat has this cool little keyboard loop I really like.  &quot;Eyes May Shine&quot; has more of a menacing beat to it, which sounds really good, and strings in part of it.  Xzibit gets rugged on this one, I love the way they put the chorus together on this track.  &quot;Positively Negative&quot; almost has a Death Row-like sound to it, and features King T.  The two talented emcees trade lines over a bumpin' beat.  I now want to clear up this thing about &quot;Paparazzi&quot;.  This song doesn't sound radio friendly at all, in fact, it condemns fake gangsta rappers over a classical-loop.  This is a great song, excellent pick for the first single to represent Xzibit.  &quot;The Foundation&quot; is produced by DJ Muggs from Cypress Hill, it is a nice piano-laced track, and definitely has a message.  Xzibit spits true game here.  &quot;Bird's Eye View&quot; is HILARIOUS!  It's a posse cut with Tash, J-Ro and Hurricane G along with E-Swift.  J-Ro does a verse making metaphors fitting with alcohol for each city: Brew York, Mi-Ti-Ami, 40-O-hio, crazy lyrics!  Xzibit and Tash rip it up too.  Classic track.  And when Tash says &quot;Lookin' down on your Moms from a bird's eye view&quot;, it's bound to get someone laughing.  &quot;Hit And Run Part II&quot; is a slower song, but has this great, laid-back keyboard lick.  It's the most relaxing thing.  Indescribable.  Xzibit raps about females here, and there's a skit with Ron Hightower, from the Steve Harvey show.  &quot;Carry The Weight&quot; is definitely the most personal song here.  Xzibit talks about his life and the things that went wrong.  It makes me sad every time I listen but it's true and beautiful.  With another classic sample-loop.  Then comes the funny songs again: &quot;Plastic Surgery&quot; featuring Ras Kass and Saafir.  A song with a jazzy little bass loop, and the three perform &quot;plastic surgery&quot; on all fake emcees to enhance their styles.  Classic.  Funny song too.To conclude, this whole album is quite good.  It shouldn't be slept on.  It's better than Xzibit's newer stuff, but that isn't bad either.  Xzibit put it down here.

However, this album is more commercially directed than focused on the pure, street-style lyrics Xzibit came up with in the past.  Though there are some good songs on his third album, there are also a lot of bad ones.  Dr. Dre\'s beats don\'t fit with Xzibit\'s style.  In fact, there are quite a few beats that don\'t fit with Xzibit\'s style here and they are not all produced by Dre.  There are some very nice songs however, like ""Been A Long Time"" which features Nate Dogg, a classic laid-back tune, ""You Know"" featuring Dr. Dre which is a diss to Death Row Records and actually is not bad at all, a heartfelt dedication with Suga Free and DJ Quik to their kids with ""Sorry I\'m Away So Much"", the remake of the old Alkaholiks track, and the ""Kenny Parker Show"" with KRS-One are the main highlights.  Other than that, we\'re given wack material such as ""F***in\' You Right"", which was produced by the amazing Soopafly, but the song is pretty bad.  Also, ""Rims And Tires"" and ""Don\'t Approach Me"" (which features MTV\'s little pet himself, Eminem) are very lame and don\'t suit Xzibit\'s style.  In order for Xzibit to drop another great album like his first two releases, he needs to rethink his musical direction.  Even if he is selling more records now, he doesn\'t want to sell his soul along with them.  This is frustrating because as a rapper Xzibit has grown with each album, but on this one the material is sub-par.  He just needs to make some more raw street tracks, and be himself, and once this all happens, perhaps Xzibit can make a middle ground and appeal to both the commercial fans and the real hip-hop fans, similar to what Nas and Kurupt did.

His solid, straight up delivery is very good to listen to.  Cormega\'s first album was originally going to be released on Def Jam Records, entitled Testament, but it never saw the light of day.  Cormega shows excellent determination by going back into the studio and making a good album to come back and let the doubters know he hasn\'t fallen off.  The Realness is simply a very good album.  The production is nicely done and the concepts are also good, showing that he has versatility.  The only real problem with The Realness is it that it doesn\'t really have the replay value of a classic hip-hop album.  Some of the tracks just aren\'t rewinders, while some definitely are, but there are enough to notice.  Cormega does show that he can handle the workload on his own, doing almost every track solo, except for a little help from Mobb Deep and Tragedy Khadafi.  Here is a song-by-song review:1. ""Dramatic Entrance"" - A great introduction to the album, the beat fits perfectly with Cormega\'s style, adding a suspenseful feel.  I\'m really feeling the lyrical content of this track, it really prepares you for the album ahead.2. ""American Beauty"" - This has a very familiar-sounding beat, the track is somewhat reminiscent of Common\'s ""I Used To Love H.E.R."".  Cormega talks about hip-hop as if it was a woman, and does a nice job with it also.  He gives shouts to DJ Premier, Dr. Dre and the Juice Crew to name a few.3. ""Thun And Kicko"" featuring Prodigy - A nice tension-building track produced by Havoc.  They do a tag-team diss here: Prodigy disses Jay-Z and Cormega takes some shots at Nas.  Overall a good track, although after a while the beat gets annoying.4. ""The Saga"" - A very nice deep track here, the beat has keyboards and harps, Cormega raps about his life on this track and it\'s very good.  He exhibits depth and good lyrical content on this song.5. ""Are You My Ni**a"" - The beat on this track is very similar to the beat on Nas\'s ""The Flyest"" from Stillmatic.  However, Cormega\'s version of the song came out first.  Core does a good performance on this track, it appears to even be aimed at Nas slightly, although it\'s not completely obvious.6. ""Unforgiven"" - Cormega tears this song up although it only lasts about two minutes.  The beat has this strange screaming effect added to it which actually helps the swing.  Overall a nice, if short, track.7. ""Fallen Soldiers"" - A real gem here, Cormega talks about his friends who have passed away.  Another excellent track with depth and meaning.  The entire song comes out well.8. ""Glory Days"" - My favorite track on the album easily, just a chill song about reminiscing on the past days.  An instant classic.  This track has been listened to over and over again.9. ""Rap\'s A Hustle"" - Nice pimp concept on this track, however the string-laced beat gets annoying.  Not really one of my favorites although it\'s a respectable song, Cormega sounds nice on it lyrically, but the beat just gets in the way.10. ""Get Out My Way"" - Good hardcore track, the horns are excellent and Cormega tears this song to pieces.  A good track to showcase his verbal abilities.  Also, he takes a little shot at Jay-Z and Nas, relating to their beef.11. ""You Don\'t Want It"" - Laid-back piano-laced track.  Seems like it was thrown together just because the time and heart in the other songs isn\'t quite there, but the atmosphere of this song is nice, it\'s still one that would be nice to hear a few times in a row.12. ""5 For 40"" - Just a quick freestyle spit done by Cormega accapella style.  He has some nicely done freestyle lyrics in this piece, though it only lasts about 40 seconds it\'s enough to prove himself on the mic.13. ""They Forced My Hand"" featuring Tragedy Khadafi - Amazing beat provided here, a definite favorite, Cormega comes off nicely and Tragedy Khadafi has a great second verse, overall a great track.14. ""Fallen Soldiers (Remix)"" - The beat on this track is much better than the original, almost heavenly but still funky-sounding.  Cormega spits different lyrics which still sound very good.  A nice remix to the original version.15. Bonus Track with Mobb Deep - All three emcees get together and rip nicely on this track, this was originally going to be on the Testament album which was never released.  Classic East Coast sound here, nice beat produced by Havoc once again.  A good ending to this album.Overall, this is excellent material and has very few flaws.  There are only about one or two songs that aren\'t good.  If you\'re into East Coast rap this album is a must-have.', 'overall': 5.0, 'summary': 'Great East Coast rap, Cormega delivers with determination.', 'unixReviewTime': 1019692800, 'reviewTime': '04 25, 2002'}","{'reviewerID': 'A1NX6JFDR8RDOC', 'asin': 'B00005LVZJ', 'reviewerName': 'Mister Hip-Hop', 'helpful': [6, 6], 'reviewText': ""Kurupt continues to come with amazing albums.  Space Boogie has Kurupt actually crossing-over, and he does a great job.  He combines his usual gangsta sound with amazing beats and a bit of commercial appeal.  But don't get this twisted: Kurupt sticks to what he's strong with.  He raps better with every album, and keeps coming off impressively.  He's the only person who could work with Everlast or Limp Bizkit and still make a great album!  Who else could do that?  Kurupt also works with his long-time friend and partner in DPG, Daz Dillinger.  Production done by Fred Wreck, DJ Quik, Daz himself, DJ Lethal, and Jon B., plus many others.  And Kurupt has Nate Dogg, Snoop Dogg, DJ Quik, Soopafly, Daz, MC Ren, Xzibit, Jon B., Everlast, and others guesting with him on Space Boogie.The album starts out with a spacy introduction.  But then follows into &quot;Space Boogie&quot;, a track with a bouncy little beat.  Kurupt rips this to shreds, some of the sound effects almost even sound like &quot;Dogg Pound Gangstas&quot; from Dogg Food.  Then Nate Dogg sings a great outro to make this a quality song.  &quot;Don't Hate On Me&quot;, sounds like a Death Row diss.  The track features Soopafly and Damani, and they rip into them with witty diss lines.  The beat is real bouncy, and Kurupt names the people Death Row seem to be hating on, like Tray D, Goldie Loc, Snoop, Soopafly and Nate.  &quot;On The Grind&quot; features Daz Dillinger, this song was also on Daz's R.A.W., but it is still a classic track.  It was one of my favorite songs on Daz's album.  A nice, laid-back gangsta track.  &quot;It's Over&quot; features Blaque, and is the first single.  It sounds a bit radio-friendly but it's a nice track, Kurupt raps quite nicely on here.  The beat is kind of happy-sounding.  &quot;Can't Go Wrong&quot; is my favorite song on the album, it's featuring DJ Quik and Butch Cassidy.  This song has a great beat, and Kurupt totally rips it.  An instant classic.  Quik also gets his rap on here and does so nicely.  The song is laced by trumpets and saxophones.  &quot;It's On, On Sight&quot; is a good bumpin' track with Kurupt coming off well.  The beat has guitars and a deep bassline.  &quot;Sunshine&quot; features Jon B., and is a nice summertime type of song.  Jon B. even sings a verse, but Kurupt raps two verses and holds his own on this song.  &quot;The Hardest&quot; is a posse cut with MC Ren, Xzibit and Nate Dogg.  The beat is rough and rugged.  Everyone gets a piece on this song, most definitely a hardcore track.  &quot;Gangstas&quot; features Daz over this beautiful, indescribable beat.  Kurupt and Daz give this song a more lazy, breezy feel.  &quot;Bring Back The Gangstas&quot; features Snoop Dogg and Goldie Loc over a beat that sounds like a mix of &quot;Stacy Adams&quot; and &quot;B-Please&quot;.  Snoop really rips on this song, Kurupt also comes off nice, Goldie Loc is all right, but his presence isn't really felt.  &quot;Lay On Back&quot; is a good track with Fred Durst of Limp Bizkit and Nate Dogg.  The only problem with this song is Durst.  His verse is pretty bad.  Luckily Kurupt and Nate rip the track to shreds, and DJ Lethal came with a nice beat, to make this a good song.  &quot;We Just Don't Give A ....&quot; is produced by DJ Lethal and he brings a nice guitar-laced beat.  Kurupt literally assaults this song.  He raps with the most proficiency I've heard from him in a long time.  &quot;At It Again&quot; is a nice party track, with a sample from a song by GUY.  It sounds a little bit like the music on Live From L.A., it's got that great California soul sound to it.  Kurupt comes off well too.  &quot;Kuruption&quot; features Everlast on a guitar-laced song.  Fred Wreck and Soopafly help with production.  Everlast sounds all right singing.  Kurupt rips it up again.  This is a political type of track.  &quot;The World&quot; is a Dogg Pound track, a funky organ beat by Daz Dillinger and Kurupt coming off his usual classic style.  There are violins here too.  Great song.  The bonus song is &quot;The Life I Live&quot; (on my album) and is a slow song with Kurupt rapping solo.  It's very soulful and Kurupt talks about his life.This is definitely one of the best albums this year.  Right up there with the D.P.G. album: Dillinger &amp; Young Gotti.  You should try that one too.  If you're into Kurupt, you should get this.  He satisfies both genres: the G-Funk audience and the pop audience.

Plus, &quot;Get Right&quot;, the remake of the Junior Mafia-Biggie song, falls so flat it should be illegal.  This definitely was one of the worst songs of 2001, possibly one of the worst songs ever made in hip-hop.  Fabolous should keep his day job because sooner or later when there's a new person the media will ride on and kids will start buying that, he'll be needing it.  If you want a great album from 2001, try D.P.G.: Dillinger &amp; Young Gotti, or Nas: Stillmatic.  Those albums will make a much better impression on the listener than this will.

Because of this, you can immediately trust Warren to come with G-Funk in its best form.  Return Of The Regulator would definitely be one of the better albums to come out this year.  Warren improves lyrically and vocally with each album, and beat-wise, one should know he's going to impress.  This album actually out-does his previous effort I Want It All (which was a West Coast classic) in some ways.  This time, Warren brings more of a street flavor to the table, and relies a bit less on assistance from guests.  However, don't expect to see Warren all by himself, he's joined by such respected West Coast stars as Butch Cassidy, his old pal Mr. Grimm, Snoop Dogg, Nate Dogg, CPO Boss Hog (who also appeared on songs with MC Ren and Tupac), WC, Soopafly, George Clinton, Kokane, LaToya Williams, El DeBarge and others.  Warren's half-brother, Dr. Dre, stops in to produce a track, and Soopafly also handles a song but Warren produced all of the other tracks.  With this effort, he establishes himself once again to prove that on his fourth album he hasn't lost his touch.  Whether it's a club single or just a laid-back song reminiscing on people he loves or his childhood, giving a positive message, or even just letting you know he hasn't fallen off, Warren proves all non-believers wrong.The album starts out with a really good introduction, which has a good old G-Funk beat and Warren's new discovery Damone puts in a verse about Warren to start the album off.  One of the better introductions I've heard in a while.  &quot;Lookin' At You&quot; is the first single from the album, produced by Dr. Dre and LaToya Williams sings on it a bit.  The beat is actually very nice and Warren rips the song, which is basically a sex track, with some good keyboard-effects added.  &quot;Here Comes Another Hit&quot; features Mr. Grimm and Nate Dogg for a fun, bouncy track.  Vintage Warren here, and it's nice to hear Mr. Grimm's voice again.  &quot;Something To Bounce To&quot; features Soopafly, who also produced the track, and it has a nice summertime feel to it.  Warren talks against people saying he fell off, and Soopafly is in his usual cool form.  &quot;This Gangsta Heat Is Too Much&quot; is a classic G-Funk track, the harmony on this cut is too good.  Warren puts in a nice performance and it's cool to hear Butch Cassidy singing on the hook, because the beat blends perfectly with his style.  &quot;Young Locs Slow Down&quot; is a positive track featuring WC, about how being young and a gangsta isn't all it's hyped up to be.  Warren and WC make a nice combination, this track is somewhat similar to &quot;Young Fun&quot; from Warren's second album, Take A Look Over Your Shoulder.  &quot;Speed Dreamin'&quot; is a funky track featuring the one and only George Clinton and Mr. Grimm again.  It has a funky beat that sounds a little happy, again nice production from Warren G, and he and Mr. Grimm trade lines, which sounds very good.  &quot;Your Sassy Ways&quot; is a 213-reunion song, and is one of the best 213 tracks to come out since, well, &quot;Game Don't Wait&quot; from I Want It All.  The beat is classic, and the introduction even has the same character who spoke on Snoop's old classic &quot;Doggy Dogg World&quot;.  The beat is so nice, and Nate Dogg blends perfectly, plus good verses from Snoop and Warren rounding this song out to be one of the album's best.  &quot;It Ain't Nothin' Wrong With You&quot; is a posse cut, featuring CPO Boss Hog, Mr. Grimm and Damone.  The song is about women and has a nice laid-back feel to it, Damone shines on this track proving he has potential.  &quot;Ghetto Village&quot; is Warren at his best, with its nice Stevie Wonder sample, Warren talks about how the ghetto was important to his success.  The song is simply real, which makes it even better to listen to.  &quot;They Lovin' Me Now&quot; is a swift track with CPO Boss Hog and Butch Cassidy, and has a typical Warren beat.  CPO comes surprisingly nicely here, and Warren also is on track.  &quot;Streets Of LBC&quot; is one of Warren's best songs, here he's solo again, and to be honest, this track wouldn't sound out-of-place on Regulate.  It's serious, interesting and realistic.  Warren's lyrics come out better than ever on this track.  &quot;G-Funk Is Here To Stay&quot; is a bouncy track that has the Battlecat sound to it, with the signature cowbell sound effect.  Warren and Mr. Grimm trade back and forth here, and Kokane comes in with his voice that sounds suspiciously similar to George Clinton, who was obviously one of his major influences.  G-Funk is truly here to stay.  &quot;Keepin' It Strong&quot; is the final track, and it's Warren rapping about personal parts of his life, such as the death of his mother and feeling lonely being on tour.  El DeBarge sings a nice chorus.  Overall a very good way to end the album.Warren definitely delivered a classic here.  The only problems with the album are the two skits, which are annoying and pointless filler, and the fact that the song he did featuring Kurupt and Daz didn't make the album.  Other than that, you can just let this album play the whole way through.  There isn't a bad song on this effort.  Every track has meaning behind it.  Get this one, especially if you like West Coast rap, that's laid-back but still has the gangsta feel to it."", 'overall': 5.0, 'summary': 'Amazing album all around, Warren G in classic form.', 'unixReviewTime': 1010102400, 'reviewTime': '01 4, 2002'}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Hey, don\'t get me wrong, there are some cool things here (some nice drum work, some good solos..but that is about it. The song writing is really lame. Dogyears is the cheesiest thing I have ever heard from Rush (except maybe roll the bones) and the rest of the album does nothing. I understand that Rush has turned away from its epic storytelling over the years and we will never again here anything like 2112 again. But thats no excuse to write such a poor album, espically to follow up Counterparts (which is in my opinion the best Rush record since Grace under Pressure, and definalty the heaviest. Stay away from this..Rush can do better then this..and since I had such a bad taste in my mouth from this album, I ignored Vapor Trails, but I have heard some cuts off of it, and it sounds a whole lot better. Why any true Rush fan would love this album is beyond me. Maybe the fans who grew up with their mid 80\'s work and really dont listen to the older stuff might like it. But I really doubt any person who thinks Farewell to Kings, Hemisphers, and  2112 were the best albums they did, would find this remotly interesting.

I still wonder this?- what if they took of two to three of the dismal cover songs, and added another two to three orginals?You MIght have had another five star Van Halen effort. All the original songs on ""Diver Down"" are outstanding. Most are just as Dark as the matrial on ""Fair Warning"". The album starts out with the cover ""Where have all the Good Times Gone"" which isnt a bad track, and it is the second best cover song on the album next to ""Pretty Women"" The first original song starts out with Hang Em High, one of the best tracks on the album. Catherdal, Secrets, Intruder, and Pretty Women are the next tracks, and they are are Great. Even though Pretty Women is a cover, it remains my favorite VH song that they covered. So Far that would be Side One if you would be listening to the album on Record, and so far the album is outstanding. Then we hit the second half of the album, where ""Diver Down"" really falls into the ocean. Dancing in the Streets is a horrid song, and it just doesnt fit here. It pretty much ruins the flow of the album...Then the album picks up steam again with Little Guitars, but then it falls flat on its face with a ragtime song ""Big Bad Bill"" once again interupting the flow of the album, then goes into the rocker and second best song on this album, The Full Bug. Finally it ends with the foolish Happy Trails...So you can see that the covers just kill this album, and even though I do like ""Where Have all the Good Times Gone"" and ""Pretty Women"" They still dont really fit with the original material on Diver Down. There are only six original songs here, with two of them being small (clocking in around a minute and a half each) instrumentals. I would have kept the ""Where have all the Good Times Gone"" and Pretty Women, but once again if they would have just added two or three more orginal tracks, the album as a whole, I gurantee, would have been outstanding.

Helmed by the lead single ""Oops (Oh My),"" a late-night R&B; heater about the joys of ""self-love,"" one might figure the rest of her album is full of jerky, overproduced Missy Elliott numbers.This is not the case.The album takes its cue more from the classic soul of the \'70s and \'80s than modern R&B; with surprising results. The album lovingly grooves along with rich vocals, soulful ballads and acoustic underpinnings.Instrumentation and musicianship take a refreshing front seat over heavily produced, trendy R&B.; Filled with impressive gems and intoxicating rhythms, there\'s a song for almost every melodic mood. ""Best Friend"" is a reclined slow jam that pares up the laid-back, no fuss stylings of Tweet to the warmth of neo-soulite Bilal.The range of Southern Hummingbird is remarkably multifaceted; from the stripped-down microphone & guitar vibe of ""Motel"" to the heartbreaking dark of ""Drunk"" which howls with carousing abandon (""I\'d rather be drunk on a cloud far away from here than sober"") and inebriating to-and-fro melody. There\'s a foray into early \'80s synth-soul with the old school-esque jam ""Make Ur Move,"" a throwback to the roller discos and poplockers of the era of excess and even tiptoes into honky-tonk country (""Complain"").Largely the artist herself culls most of the album\'s more potent material. Her more than 10 years toiling as an aspiring solo artist have paid off: Her skills as a songwriter, drummer and acoustic guitarist are impressively detailed here.More complex than anything that can currently be offered up by a trio of ""bootylicious"" singers or a girl that\'s not yet a woman, Tweet\'s voice exhibits a unique redolence similar to the soul sirens of the seventies - Minnie Riperton, Evelyn Champagne King and Angela Bofill - rather than keeping up with the interchangeable chicks featured on the hook of a rap track.She is distinctive amongst the crowded school of R&B; fish.

The lead singer of that oft-mocked zillion-selling 90s outfit has stepped out on his own with his first collection of solo tunes. The album finds Darius at a mature point in his life: reflective on its meaning and speaking of reappropriation, a settling down, a going back home - Back To Then.  Darius Rucker\'s debut is a contrastive departure from the familiar alterna-pop of yore that his fans have previously come to expect. The album is a homegrown journey into his ecclesiastical South Carolina roots: smothered in country fried soul, down-home gospel and heartfelt lyricism.The album fits its namesake, laid-back and reclined in nature. It is a warm, melodic record that conjures up images of dusty country roads, white-walled roadside congregations, collard greens and hominy grits with the sugar in it. Rucker\'s hickory-smoked vocals breathe of a man learned in the classics of 1970s soul with harmonies reminiscent of Al Green and Teddy Pendergrass.The winners of this gospel-inflected charmer are numerous: ""Wild One"" is southern juke joint funk that evokes the soul of old. ""Somewhere,"" is a spiritual number so drenched in the gospel with its sparkling organs and crystalline harmonies that it can put even the most fervent nonbeliever back in the habit. ""Sometimes I Wonder"" with neo-soul queen Jill Scott serves as one of the year\'s sultriest duets taking every little piece of your heart, while ""Hold On,"" an optimistic ode to those amid adversity rings true with lines like ""she works all day to put herself through school, `cause financial aid doesn\'t seem to cover food."" His grooves are an amalgamation of blues and rhythm.Rucker\'s album with all its charm does tend to be racked with predictability that at times doesn\'t fit the richness encapsulated within Rucker\'s deep baritone and suffers from a standard ""don\'t-rock-the-boat"" production quality. Overall, Back To Then is surprisingly thoughtful and upbeat with definite winners throughout reminding the Fairweather Johnsons of the world that sometimes there is virtue in serendipity.', 'overall': 4.0, 'summary': 'Respectable debut for Rucker', 'unixReviewTime': 1034553600, 'reviewTime': '10 14, 2002'}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The rhymes are easy to understand yet far from dumbed down.The production is great, even though the album is not something to admire just because of that. Sean Combs and Easy Mo Bee handle the beats perfectly, in which they enhance the lyrics. However, there are exceptions, with the DJ Premier produced ""Unbelievable"" and the Lord Finesse produced ""Suicidal Thoughts"".The guest spots are extremely minimal, only limited to Method Man on ""The What"".

""Death Certificate"" shows some slight changes and actually follows a loose concept on both sides of the album. Ice Cube explains it as: ""The Death Side [tracks 1-11]: a mirror image of where we are today; The Life Side [12-20]: a vision of where we need to go."" The Death Side takes on the gangster style, focusing on topics such as violence and drugs, while The Life Side laces the gangster style with a conscious style. Nonetheless, Ice Cube\'s lyrics tell stories about situations that are rampant on both sides. For example, ""A Bird in the Hand"" deals with the situations of making it on your own by selling drugs, because a criminal record that limits job opportunities makes it impossible to find a job that makes an affordable wage. Another example is ""Look Who\'s Burnin"", which tells about the spread of STD\'s in low income neighborhoods. I\'m not going to spoil the whole record, but Ice Cube does prove a point with his lyrical content, despite accusations of racism with the track ""Black Korea"".The production is quite different as well. No more East Coast styles of the Bomb Squad here. Instead, Sir Jinx, Boogiemen and Ice Cube produce the album with samples from soul and p-funk groups/artists such as James Brown and Parliament, thus you can safely said that it has the West Coast vibe of the early 90\'s. G-Funk? Not even close, wait another two years for that.I believe that it\'s safe to say that ""Death Certificate"" is yet another classic for Ice Cube that still sounds pleasant even after over 15 years later.

Truth is, he was shot AT nine times, only 3 of the bullets hit him (one in the jaw, one in each leg). The real ""50 Cent"" was a robber known as Kelvin Martin, and he survived many bullet wounds (24 to be exact), but tragically, he died from the wounds in 1987.Luckily, Martin doesn\'t have to live in a time when hip hop has reached its demise and is overflooded by fake, overmarketed hip pop idols such as Fiddy Cent. This CD is just proof that you don\'t need talent to make it big, and if you have talent, the media could care less.First off, Fiddy can\'t rap to save his life. It might be the bullet that hit his jaw, but this guy sounds like a complete mess. Plus, there is multiple repetitiveness in lyrical content. The background beats are rather annoying and have no depth or soul to them. It\'s just nauseating. Listen to the song ""In Da Club"".

After he departed the group in 1989, he starts recording under his own name, in which he can express his ideas well without anything holding him back. After many listens to this album, I can easily say that this is the best thing that has ever been released by an N.W.A. affiliated member? Why do I say that?First off, Ice Cube was one impressive lyricist. While he kept his gangsta rap roots that he got from N.W.A., he also adds a conscious twist to his lyrics not unlike Public Enemy and KRS-One/BDP. Cube addressed real-life situations in his songs, whether it would be police brutality based on the Rodney King incident(""Endangered Species""), unplanned pregnancy and trying to get out of it (""You Can\'t Fade Me""), talking to the kids (""A Gangster\'s Fairytale"") or even a battle of the sexes involving female rapper Yo-Yo in ""It\'s a Man\'s World"". Whatever situation Cube brought up, he always knew how to bring it up perfectly through his rhymes.The Bomb Squad\'s production is ace. The samples used, featuring newscasts and other sayings based on Cube\'s lyrics, blend in a perfect sense. It\'s completely original and even stands the test of time with its style.Along with this West Coast classic, we also have the ""Kill at Will"" EP included as well, being originally released in late 1990, not many months after this. The EP tracks feature a remix of ""Endangered Species"", in which Chuck D from Public Enemy raps a completely new verse, the multi-instrumental beats used with Cube\'s rapping in ""Jackin\' for Beats"", and the single ""Dead Homiez"" that focuses on killings in urban society. ""Kill at Will"" has 4 newer tracks, 2 remixes of AMW tracks and a short interlude.This is definitely the package to pick up if you want to hear Ice Cube at the top of his game.

Tha Problem vs The Hustla - 10/10 Cassidy in a freestyle rap battle with himself. hes battling his former self which was the dayz of hotel with him and R Kelly and with his true self the Hustla who brought us the Mixtapes punchlines and who\'s true to the streets. this looks like the end of personallity change and split personallity as cassidy rips his former self. a very hot intro and one of my favorite on the album2. I\'m A Hustla - 10/10 most of you have heard this song already and its been out for almost 6 months. very hot track produced by swiss beats.3. On The Grind - 8/10 this sonds more like a slow song to me or a laid back song as you can tell in cassidy\'s voice. still a good track though.4. Crack - 10/10 HOTT track, the beat is nice, and the lyrics are on point. cassidy rapping about crack and how he was associated with it.5. B-Boy Stance - 10/10 This track has next single all over it. the beat is banging the lyrics are great. its definetely a banger for the streets and for the club.6. Am 2 The PM - 10/10 Great track, definetely a street song. lyrics are on point cassidy raps his gun talk on this one.7. Can\'t Fade Me (ft. Nas & Quan) - 10/10 this track is more of a soulful song, nas starts it of with a verse, as Quan sing in the background and kicks a verse after nas. kinda reminds you of another version of Just a Moment.8. Kick It With You (ft. Mario) - 9/10 cassidy kick it here for the ladies. its a pretty good song. no really need to skip but it really for the women.9. C-Bonics - 10/10 beat is great and goes well with cassidy\'s flow. its back 2 the streets for cassidy to rip the mic and ashow his skills again.10. Bellybutton - 8/10 cassidy goes back to the ladies on this track. the track songs kinda corny for a song to the ladies as cassidy tells the girls to lift their shirt up to see the girls bellybutton. i guess its an alright song, kinda sounds like get no better part II since cassidy\'s soft and laidback rhythm is back on this track.11. Get Em - 10/10 this is my personal favorite track of the entire album. the track is straight fire, his lyrics are the strongest on this and the beat goes well with him as hes ripping the mic on this one.12. So Long (ft. Raekwon & Mashonda) - 9/10 this is another of for the ladies again with a Wu Tang kind of vibe into it. not bad of a track its good but its not fire.13. 6 Minutes Of Death (Ft. Lil Wayne & Fabolous) - 10/10 o say it aint so. 2 topnotch lyricist and a punchline prince on a 6 minute track. all three of them rip up the mic like crazy. the song starts of with Lil Wayne then Fabolous showing his skill then cassidy ends the track and tears it up to end it in a bang. dont skip this track its just nice.14. The Message - 9.5/10 this track samples the beat from Wu Tang\'s ""Hollow Bones"" that was feature one Wu\'s The W Album. cassidy goes political rapping about the black race. song is about the black race and being proud of the black race. its definetely a good song and a song that has a good message to it.15. I\'m A Hustla (Remix) (Ft. Mary J Blige) - 8/10 - Mary J gets on this track making a more soulful track to his first single. to be honest the original song was much better, i just couldnt put up hearing Mary J saying ""Cuz you hustle"" anymore, it just made the track sound more corny. therfore i gave it a 8.to rap this up, the album has its ladies songs and has its street songs. but compared to split personality this one has one 3 of 15 girl songs on them which isnt bad. overall album i give it a 9.7/10its definetely one of the top albums of this summer to get. i highly recommend you getting this album as its worth every penny.', 'overall': 5.0, 'summary': 'The Wait Is Over, The Real Cassidy is Here!', 'unixReviewTime': 1119916800, 'reviewTime': '06 28, 2005'}","{'reviewerID': 'A3CY5UH5JR4MJT', 'asin': 'B0009A401G', 'reviewerName': 'BDP87 ""KRS""', 'helpful': [0, 0], 'reviewText': 'wow...i mean wow....this is true millenium east coast music. if you have a taste for banging beats, a young kid on the mic going buckwild throw and flowing and showing new style, then this is an album that youll really like. i guess its cuz Jay Z had came to his senses since his Black Album, and thinking about he doesnt wanna go pop no more and go strong with his lyrical flow, almost all roca fella album is for the streets.', 'overall': 5.0, 'summary': 'this is what the streets been waiting for`', 'unixReviewTime': 1119139200, 'reviewTime': '06 19, 2005'}","{'reviewerID': 'A3CY5UH5JR4MJT', 'asin': 'B0009HLDA0', 'reviewerName': 'BDP87 ""KRS""', 'helpful': [1, 2], 'reviewText': 'yea good job BET, this is great for declining the culture of hip hop with suger coated, commercial wack music like this...way to go keep doing you thing, cant believe guys actually like this garbage, these days, even the hardest cats on the streets are turning soft with corny music like this...same goes for Pretty Ricky and Bow Wow', 'overall': 1.0, 'summary': 'o great', 'unixReviewTime': 1119312000, 'reviewTime': '06 21, 2005'}","{'reviewerID': 'A3CY5UH5JR4MJT', 'asin': 'B0009K7RBG', 'reviewerName': 'BDP87 ""KRS""', 'helpful': [3, 6], 'reviewText': ""This guy is everything wrong with hip hop. all i hear out his mouth is Women, Bi*ches, Cars, Sex, and Pimps. o yea like thats new to the world. only thing i like about the album is the beats, but would i buy the album just for the beats? webbie destroys the album with wack lyrics and horrible content. and look at the front cover.

Then I purchased the cd a few years later and still wasn\'t impressed. But now, I am older (and wiser), I grown to not only love but appreciate Madonna\'s honestly when it comes to life and love. Like most people on here have stated, this cd is not about sex. There are only two songs that reflect this, but Madonna sings about sex in such an imaginative and creative way, you don\'t feel nasty about it. You feel like someone told the truth on a subject most Americans are too embarrassed to discuss or to be honest about and as a result, this will probably go down as Madonna\'s most underrated work. Janet Jackson went this route AFTER Madonna made it a success and even Madonna considers this album to be one of the best two albums of her career. My favorite songs are:Erotica-I never understood what the big deal about this song was. Many people have erotic fantasies about sex. The song subject is backed pounding and dark club beat.Fever- Madonna does a great job in covering this song.Bye Bye Baby- I loved this song the first moment I heard it, but I hated the ending (now I love it). The song has a hip pop beat.Deeper and Deeper- an instant classic. Although Madonna attempted to celebrate the 70s with this song, she actually created a sound that transcends time/era.Where Life Begins- love this song and I love Madonna ""wink wink"" lyrics. The song is backed with a jazzy feel that\'s romantic.Bad Girl- one of Madonna\'s greatest ballads. I often wondered if the song is about her because the lyrics sound so personal.Waiting- this song should have been a single, although it\'s not radio friendly at all. Madonna mostly talks in this song about waiting for love and she is backed bySecret Garden- I never try to fully understand what Madonna is talking about in her songs, but I think there is a reason why she let this song be the last song on this very dark album. I feel the song offers hope. It offers a chance to feel what love and sex should be about, romance, and to find partnership with someone of the same mind and maybe start a family. Madonna is backed by 60s style jazz.It\'s a shame people still ignore this music that was so ahead of it\'s time.

This album is one of the best r&amp;b albums this year, right behind Aaliyah and Alicia Keyes\'s album. This album features strong songwriting, innovative productions and fine singing. I must admit I had to listen to this album three times before I got into it, but I got it now and I love it. Here\'s a breakdown: No Matter What (Party All Night Long) is an awesome record. It\'s a mixture of r&amp;b, pop, dance and rock. On this song, Toya sings about party with her girls no matter what happens. How Can I Be Down is slamming. How many times have you been attracted to guy who was too fine and too fly for words? That\'s what the song is about. I Do is her hit single but in my opinion the weakest song on the album. I Do pt.2 is much better. The Truth is a record that reminds me a little of the 70\'s. However, it\'s very today\'s. Think has an 80\'s vibe to it and it kind of reminds me of A. Franklin\'s song Think. Don\'t Make Me mixes Latin grooves with an r&amp;b beat. She really sings on this track. Moving On is the only really slow ballad on this album. It\'s about mourning someone who passed away and not being able to let go. What Else Can I Do is a ballad with a great beat. Outstanding vocals on this track. Untouchables made me laugh (I don\'t know why). Maybe it reminded me of high school, but anybody can listen to this track. Book Of Love tells it the way it should be told. It gives a woman\'s perspective on relationship. I especially love the reference to the movie/book ""Waiting To Exhale"". What\'s A Girl To Do is funny, but very believable. On this track, Toya must choose between a wealthy guy or the guy who treats her right. She decides to keep both. I Messed Up is a song where Toya admits it\'s her fault why her relationship with her man has soured. A mid-tempo track with very good singing on this track. Bounce is the kind of song Britney Spears performs, but Toya\'s performance makes it soulful. Fiasco is my favorite song because it speaks so much truth. If you dated a popular guy that every girl wanted, but had doubts about giving in to him...this song is for you. Awesome beats. I Do, Pt.2 is a ten times better than the original version. She sings this song very seductive.The verdict: Toya will blow up someday.

She is trying to re-defined music, so it can last 50 more years. 20 years from now, this EP will be more respected. Now for a run down:1.""Intro / World keeps turnin"": a very nice vibed out beat with Erykah just flowing. Nice.2. ""Bump it"": Old school mixed with new school.

""Back in the day"":  Erykah sings about the good days in music on this track and Lenny Kravitz guest stars on this track. Very 80s-like. This track took me back.4. ""I want you"": This track in TOTALLY different for R&B.; I haven\'t heard an R&B; track so different since the 70s. Basically, all Erykah is singing is ""I Want You"", but the WAY she sings it is a real treat. The production on this is crazy bangin. I describe this as an electronic-R&B-funk; track.5.

I know a lot of people didn't like her first cd &quot;Whoa, Nelly&quot; because of her vocals and her music was so different. This time, the music sinks into you more easily. Some songs require more than one listening. But it's all worth it. Also her vocals have really matured and she sounds great. I love Canada for many things, but producing Nelly is one of the top reasons. Lets break it down:1. One-Trick Pony- I really love this song. What an inspiring song about being yourself (no matter how different you may be). She uses a banjo on this song. How cool!2. Powerless (Say What You Want)- as a black person, this song says so much to me. But the song is so universal that anybody can relate to it.3. Explode- probably my 2nd favorite song. This song makes me dance and it talks about being teenagers and learning your lessons. I really love the beats and she is singing on this song.4. Try - beautiful song about trying to be a good person because of another person. It continues the theme of growing up that's on this album.5. Fresh Off the Boat- Nelly talks about her family leaving their native country for NA. She's proud of her culture.6. Forga- I really love this song and the title is of her native language. Makes you dance.7. Saturdays - a song about how she spent her childhood's Saturdays. I love the fact that its only her, a guitar and a backing soulful male singer.8. Picture Perfect- the music is rather bluesy when it starts off and then just explodes with the chorus. IMO, the song talks about how some things are not what they appear to be.9. The Grass Is Green- a good mid-temp rock song. I love this song, but not as much as I love the others.10. Build You Up- Nelly has grown up a lot and you can tell with this song. She is talking about finding your soul mate and accepting both the good and bad about him. She's also talking about how people build you up to tear you down. I love the Latin sounds of this song.11. Island of Wonder- wow!! This is favorite song on the album. She is singing with a Portuguese man (one of her idols and a music icon in Portugal) and their voices sounds amazing.12. Childhood Dream- with a beautiful church organ playing in the background in the beginning and elsewhere. Nelly sings with so much passion on this song.

But the rest of the songs, except for ""How Do You Do"", ""Illegal"" and ""Timor"" (although corny, but with an excellent message) are boring and bland. This is the thing I don\'t understand...she has one of the greatest producers of all time, Rick Rubin only serving as her executive producer....WHY?! Part of the reason why this cd is so flat is because Shakira produces everything by herself and you can tell the pressure got to her. While I respect the fact that this woman is in control of her career, it is clear she is not ready to produce ALL songs by herself. ""Hips Don\'t Lie"" is saving this album because she WORKED with someone on that song. In time, Shakira will become a great producer but right now she needs help.

Both ""Whoa, Nelly!"" and especially ""Folklore"" never received the credit it deserved.

In other words, she took a page from Gwen Stefani but does that mean she sold out? No, because Nelly\'s fans know she was a R&B; artist (or very close to it) in Canada before her debut.I must admit, it took several listenings before I accepted this album. But I think this album will put Nelly in the right direction to a wider fan base. This album is still alot better than what I hear on radio today. So give her credit.

On one hand she dominated country music for a few years, even winning ""Entertainer of the Year"" one year. However, Reba and her music are not considered ""important"" and her impact is considerably low when you compare her with other country female giants like Pasty Cline, Loretta Lynn, Tammy Wynette, Emmylou Harris or Dolly Parton.In Nashville, Reba is a legend but outside of Nashville, she is just another successful country female singer. Whenever there\'s a list of greatest female artists list, Reba\'s name is always missing. Even on ""Greatest Country Female Singers"" lists, while she is ranked in the Top 10, she is losing ground to alternative country female artists like Shania Twain, The Dixie Chicks and even Faith Hill. Being that I am VERY selected with country music, I always wondered what happened with Reba. Now I know...Reba\'s music is rather predictable and this duet album is no different from her other efforts. Her choice of Kelly Clarkston recent hit ""Because of You"" was, well...a predictable choice. The up-tempo numbers lacks energy and Reba\'s voice (while great) sounds too loud compared to her partners. Her choice of duet partners was VERY predictable and rather short coming because you really expect (or hope) she would hook up with other artists rather than pop and country. Is that all she listens to?I am very disappointed in this duet album because I feel Reba is limiting herself for the sake of sales.

However, her charms and looks will only get her so far and I suspect as she matures, people will demand for her to put more punch into her sound or will tire of her easily and find another singer.Vocally, Taylor is very limited. She lacks tone, her country accent is forced, and her vocals are rather monotone (no fire whatsoever). Studio machines covers up what her live performances cannot. Now, I don't want to blast Taylor too harshly because she is only 18 and I do see some hope on this album.Love Story is a mid-tempo, accompanied by banjo and guitar in which she sings about her Romeo whom her father will not let her see. White Horse is a country pop ballad which talks about her being rejected in a relationship.

""Bad Example"" continues where ""Hell On Heels"" left off by showing these gals as some \'bad chicks\' (in a good way). ""Housewife\'s Prayers"" is so smooth and sad because you know millions of women can identify with being neglected in their marriages and drowning in despair in their homes. ""Takin Pills\' is funny but it leads alot to be desired. I wished they had developed that song more.

""The Hunter\'s Wife"" is wild to me bcause when was the last time you heard a country song sing about eating coon\'s stew?

As I type this right now, I am scrolling through and looking at the negative reviews. One says that Bellamy\'s voice is ""rubbish"", and that ""he wants to be Jeff Buckley"". I don\'t see the resemblance- the falsetto is just Bellamy\'s style. And that said, I think Bellamy has one of the best singing voices of recent times.Origin of Symmetry is definitely Muse at their peak, beginning with ""New Born"", which begins with a nightmarish piano riff you\'d hate to hear in the dark while you\'re trying to sleep. Then more piano kicks in and Bellamy\'s soft vocals just help the song drift off. Then a totally [...] guitar riff kicks in and the band just explodes, the song soon turns into a kick-in-the-teeth metal song. Then the second track, ""Bliss"", which is Muse\'s best song, begins with a dreamy keyboard riff that makes you think of an island somewhere far away, then the rest of the band kick in and give us 4 minutes of pure kickass. ""Hyper Music"" cuts away from the soft, dreamy intros and just explodes into a great metal track.Song number 5, ""Plug in Baby"", is one of the best tracks on the album, and one of their biggest tracks ever. Sure the title is enough to make you cringe (to the point where your muscles tension up) but aside from the lame title, it\'s one hell of a rocker. ""Micro Cuts"" is Queen-esque Muse at work, and is just enough to make you claim this as their best album.

I wish I could say the same about her vocals though.Either:1. She recorded this album when she had an extremely sore throat2. She hardly got any sleep while recording this album3. She\'s just plain bored of making musicBecause here, her voice sounds tired and strained. She REALLY let it all out on From this Moment On, hell, she even scatted. But here, she sings in that breathy, bored style every pop singer sings in nowadays.Several songs here are missed opportunites. The Boy From Ipanema (pretty much the reverse version of The Girl from Ipanema"") sounds BO-RING due to her bored voice. ""Walk On By""... huh. The title is quite apt, because it describes what I feel like doing when that song comes on. Have you heard the chorus? She\'s REALLY straining her voice here. Had she just sung it out like on previous efforts, maybe it wouldn\'t have been so unbearable. Speaking of unbearable, Song #7... her attempt at singing an entire song in Portugese is terrible. My sister walked by my room and asked ""Why is she singing in random gibberish?"". Can\'t blame her, the way Krall constantly mispronounces words it sounds like gibberish (trust me, I used to go to school with this one Brazillian guy, and when he spoke Portugese it sounded great and really natural). And ""I\'ve Grown Accustomed To His Face""... ugh. ""Aiiive groan accustemed to hes feeeece!""What a disappointing outing. Such a good opportunity wasted here.

That three star rating means I think this album has some good points and *gasp* some bad points, so please, bear with me here.I will not get into how much I love Metric, because I love them but I\'m not someone who discovered them before everyone else. I love their music, I\'m not a fanboy however. I got into them after hearing ""Poster of a Girl"" and loving it, so I bought Live it Out right away. I own Fantasies on vinyl, and as much as I like a number of tracks, the album is somewhat of a disappointment for me, but I can\'t exactly comprehend exactly what it is.The first six tracks... or better yet, tracks 2-6 are easily the best on the album. But what about Help I\'m Alive? Well it\'s catchy but I don\'t think it\'s a great opener per se. The ""Beeeating like a haaaammeeerrrrr..."" part repeats for half the song and becomes annoying after a few minutes. However, Sick Muse is a great The Smiths-esque track and maybe the best on the album, despite the rather repetitive chorus. Satellite Mind is catchy and Gold Guns Girls is reminiscent of their Live it Out days. Twilight Galaxy is a beautiful song and probably one of their best, and the catchiest track on the album is Gimme Sympathy which I imagine being a good singalong song at concerts.So as you can gather from the above paragraph, I can listen to tracks 2-6 without problem and without skipping. Unfortunately Gimme Sympathy is followed by tracks 7-9, which are three straight boring ballads in a row. I literally can\'t remember a thing about them except the fact that the intro to one of them sounds like one of the tracks off of Mother Mother\'s album ""O My Heart"", and me wanting to hear that song as opposed to the BS I was hearing. If they were maybe better placed I\'d be able to appreciate them more, because when I hear them all in a row, I get more interested in what I am doing while listening to them rather then listening to them.Stadium Love slightly redeems the album, but all too similar to Help I\'m Alive, it doesn\'t make for a good closer... its sound kind of tries too hard to make it sound like the album is going to end on a high note, but by the time I\'m finished listening to it, a lot is left desired. Don\'t get me wrong, I love the song, and I imagine it being fun at a concert. It just doesn\'t serve as a good closer, at least in my opinion.In short, this album is a rather mixed bag for me.

When I heard about it I was thinking ""another rushed release? Didn\'t they release an album last year?"". But then I heard this album.This is a PHENOMENAL release from The Mars Volta. Gone are the rushed songs, the Alvin-and-the-chipmunks vocal pitch, the ""let\'s play random crap for 8 minutes"" approach. This is on par with Amputechture as The Volta\'s best album yet. The only album of theirs I found disappointing was The Bedlam in Goliath. This album is freaking solid from first track to last.If you hated the rushed and repetitive feel of The Bedlam in Goliath as much as I do, have no fear. The Mars Volta have returned to their diverse and concentrated style. Yes there are blazing fast songs, but there are some ballads on here that are AMAZING.The album starts off slowly with ""Since We\'ve Been Wrong"". It starts off quitely and slowly, and then gets into a ballad with beautiful melody. For 3/4 of the song there\'s no drums, then towards the end the drums kick in. This is an exceptional way to start off a TMV album.Next is ""Teflon"". This is an awesome song, great lyrics, very catchy, good bass line, the song leaves my ears begging for more. Like Viscera Eyes, but better.""Halo of Nembutals"" is next. I find the more this album goes on the more I love it. Slow intro, then segueing into a very TMV-ish Mars Volta rocker. Great lyrics, awesome music... eargasm in it\'s own right.""With Twilight As My Guide"" slows down the pace a bit. A very strange song, and very ear-catching. This may be the second best song on the album actually. It\'s very slow, has a dream-like surreal feel to it.Of course, each TMV album has to have the catchy 3 minute song, and ""Cotopaxi"" is just that. It\'s VERY This Apparatus Must Be Unearthed meets Inertiatic ESP. Gets my blood pumping every time, it has a very anthemic feel to it as well. I\'m not surprised this is a single, it may be the new Inertiatic ESP feel to it.""Desperate Graves"" is the album\'s best song, it\'s an awesome 5 minute epic that makes you think ""THIS is Mars Volta!"". No words to describe this song... it\'s an epic and magical song.""Copernicus"" is next. It\'s a slow 7 minute ballad, it has that ""stranded in the desert at nightfall"" vibe to it. Great vocals, awesome musicianship.Then the closer, ""Luciforms"". I never thought The Mars Volta would make a closer that rivals ""Take The Veil Cerpin Taxt"", and they just so happened to have done that. 8 minutes, it\'s very surreal, and I LOVE the piano! It just adds that vibe to it. What a great way to close a different album.I know those expecting ""De-Loused"" part 2 will think ""Oh no, Amputechture all over again"". Personally, I love it. It\'s WAY better than TBIG, it\'s more dynamic, ALL the songs are worthy of repeat value. I\'m so buying the physical copy!This is a different direction for the Volta, and I LOVE it.

If that\'s the case, then I think Coheed should go back to ripping off Rush and Iron Maiden.Coheed are very talented, and frustratingly so. If anything, the first two albums are two of the greatest achievements in Prog Rock if you ask me. Then their third album came ad it was somewhat quite middling. A lot of good on there, a lot of decent, a lot of bad. Then the fourth, No World For Tomorrow... I don\'t think there were any memorable tunes on that disc. OK, I Liked the title track and Gravediggers and Gunslingers. And On The Brink was good too.Well, with this album, Josh is gone. In comes Chris Pennie, an extraordinarily talented drummer. A nice bloke too, I met him back in October. Also returning is the lack of any memorable songs. None of the tunes on this disc would rate above a 2/5.I actually don\'t like any of the songs of this disc. As I stated, the highest I can give any of the songs is a 2/5. Every track feels out of place in the cotext of the one before it. The only tune on this disc that sounds like it fits on a Coheed disc is When Skeletons Live, and even that track sounds out of place, like they had to rush in a track that sounds like old Coheed. The best tune on the album, This Shattered Symphony, Has an amazing opening and chorus, but is ruined by a totally lame part before the chorus. Same thing with Guns of Summer, despite the awesome drumming. The Broken starts off awesome but quickly falls flat on it\'s face. World of Lines sounds like they took the boring parts of No Prayer For The Dying, and threw them into one song.I can\'t even stomach Here We Are Juggernaut, with the chorus being amazing and everything else being cringe worthy. The intro to In The Flame of Error and the chorus rule but everything else is ruined by what ruins the whole album- Coheed having interesting parts of songs, then suddenly going off into a wild tangent. Hence the ""pretentious"" part. They\'re trying too hard.Then of course, what should be The highlight ofthe album is actually their worst song EVER, and may even be one of the worst songs I\'ve ever heard. It is essentially just noodling around for 7 minutes. Not even the bizarre and creepy coda at the end could redeem it. Here\'s the thing guys. I love heavy metal. I love electronica. I love Prog. I don\'t love it when a band forces everything into a Blender at once, thus creating a pretentious mix that is as cringe worthy as it gets.Also, the lyrics are disastrous. I remember when their lyrics not only told a story but were very painful and had you relating. Here they\'ve clearly taken a step back in that department. ""Rain down fire and BUUUUUUURN US AAAAAAALLLLLLLLL!!!!!!!"" ugh, seriously? I am all for angry lyrics but this is just stupid.Look, Coheed are much better than this. They have TALENT.

""Bloody Mary"", mainly because it reminds me of early Garbage material, and Lady Gaga sounds a lot like Shirley Manson on it. Her voice is so beautiful on it, its insane.

As a fan of The Mars Volta for 6 years, I'll admit I was just a tad doubtful as to whether or not they could ace it on this album. But a 3 year break did give me some hope, as until then they'd been releasing albums constantly. On this album you can tell they took some time to really give it their all.This album, for one is very surprisingly DARK. I'll admit I was a hit shocked at the first track- not that I didn't like it, I actually loved it, but it was unexpectedly very dark. It even kind of resembles a Dance of Death era Iron Maiden track, meets Stabbing Westward and Pendulum. Thankfully, it set the tone for the rest of the album.Most of the album has a very dreamy, surreal feel to it. The signature sound of The Mars Volta is still there, but it's mixed with darker and lower key elements that give it a very diverse feel. I'm honestly unsure of what my favourite track is. I'd say it's In Absentia, as well as I love Trinkets Pale of Moon. Both are very dreamy and chaotic yet oh so controlled.I especially love the new drummer. I'll admit I wasn't a huge fan of Thomas Pridgen's going Crazy every 5 seconds does get tiresome after a while, so Deantoni Parks's newer style definitely owns the place. Also, I love how the band has managed to keep the uber high vocals to a bare minimum.

That means I think the album has good points, and -dramatic music- bad points too.If you down thumb my review, please state why, as I\'m not someone who gives everything in near sight a 4 or 5 star rating. The purpose of a review is to state your opinion and not to act all fanboyish over the product at hand. You\'re not going to change my opinion, and I wouldnt dream of changing yours. But if in the comments, you have some insightful comments to offer, like ""listen to this track again, there\'s a lot you might have missed"", I might just consider it.I\'ll admit, I\'m in ways, a latecomer to the Muse party. I didn\'t get into them until 2009. I heard all their albums before the Resistance and loved them all. Resistance is not a bad album, it\'s a decent one and despite a few cringe worthy tunes, there were still some good ones. When I heard the derpstep in the trailer for this album, I was a tad worried. Is their new album really a pile of dubstep crap? Are they jumping on the bandwagon, when they\'re such a ridiculously talented band? Nonetheless, after hearing the Olympics song, which I really disliked, and Madness, which was a nice tune, and Unsustainable, which is a nice mix of genres and the dubstep track, I figured I\'d give it a listen.And so it\'s at this point where I\'m guessing you\'re expecting a justification of my rating for the album. If you took away the two dubstep-tinged tracks, you have just another Muse album. Which is exactly the problem- Muse have played it too safely with this album and decided to just take the classic Muse approach. While it isn\'t bad, it leaves me thinking that band are so much more talented than this, and that they could write, and innovate in different ways if they wanted to. Notice how different ""Origin of Symmetry"" is from ""Showbiz""? And ""The Resistance"" from ""Black Holes""? Yet all of them have the ""Muse"" sound, that remains consistent through the band\'s albums. Problem is, the band didn\'t change much from The Resistance. They just figured ""that album sold, and we could record ourselves taking a shower and folks will eat it up"", so they just went with... Muse, as a sound for the album. Even if Chris states that ""We tried something radically different"", he\'s wrong, it\'s just another Muse album.""Supremacy"" starts off the album, and it\'s a decent tune. Has a bit of a 007 feel to it, like it wouldn\'t be out of place in the new James Bond movie, ""Skyfall"". The verses are cool and I love the big drums as well as the marching drum beat throughout. The strings are probably the first thing you notice about the tune, and while they don\'t totally intrude, sadly the song could have survived without them. ""Madness"" is next. The song has the underlying motif of a beat built around Matt softly singing ""M-m-m-m-m-m-m-m-mad-mad-mad"", which obviously amounts to him completing the word ""madness"" at the end. The song\'s lyrics were written after Bellamy got in a fight with his girlfriend Kate Hudson, and are nice and heartfelt. Towards the end, the song starts to take a bit of a U2 direction, as it wouldn\'t sound out of place on the ""Zooropa"" album.Next is ""Panic Station"", a song that sounds a bit like a mix of a Franz Ferdinand tune and ""Supermassive Black Hole"". It\'s catchy and all, but it just isn\'t what Muse is known for. I don\'t hate it like everyone else does,  but I\'d willingly skip it, and the next track, ""Prelude"", which isn\'t really important at all.Sadly, Muse will never live down the next track, ""Survival"". It was written for the Olympics, and hell, even that annoying ""I Believe"" song by Nikki Yanofsky (the song of the Vancouver 2010 winter Olympics) feels more Olympics than this. The opening of the tune is cringe worthy, but thankfully when the singing kicks in, it starts to get tolerable, until the choir from The Omen soundtrack start chanting ""So I told you"" and ""You were warned and didn\'t listen"" for absolutely no reason at all. The song is easy the most over-the-top thing I\'ve ever heard in my life, and not in a good way. If you want to write a song for the Olympics, why not just do a typical Muse track like ""Time is Running Out"" or ""Resistance"", instead of wasting a perfectly talented choir and making it sound like Queen singing a theme for a Tim Burton movie?Thankfully things pick up afterword, with the next track being ""Follow Me"". It starts with the sound of a baby\'s heart beat, and Matt crooning a lovely tune. The song starts to sound a bit like ""MK Ultra"" from their previous albums before the dubstep beat kicks in, and even then it\'s tolerable. It\'s a fun track that at the same time sounds really much like a filler track. ""Animals"" might be my favourite song in the album- a soft, subdued rocker that wouldn\'t be out of place on Origin of Symmetry, and reminds me a bit of a more uptempo ""Screenager"". The song closes with a rather frightening sound clip from the Wall Street Trading Floor, which explains the song\'s meaning- it\'s about the greed of people in the stock market, and how they show no regard for others, only caring about themselves. Sadly, it\'s followed by ""Explorers"", a song so forgettable I can\'t even remember anything about it.Big Freeze is a catchy tune, but THOSE LYRICS. While listening to it, I thought to myself, ""if I hear the words Don\'t give up\' one more time, I\'m throwing this CD in the garbage"", as I heard them several times throughout (and similar phrases too). It\'s a shame, because the song\'s music is fine enough. ""Save Me"" and ""Liquid State"" are most known for having Christopher Wolstenholme singing. As he\'s my favourite member of the band, I was anticipating these tracks greatly. And he\'s a decent singer, he sounds a bit like the guy from Finger Eleven. But there\'s a reason he doesn\'t sing for Muse. ""Liquid State"" is the better of these two tracks, mainly because it\'s faster and heavier, but both tracks are really forgettable and the album would have survived without them.The last two tracks are the finale of the album, and both are very different. Starting off with ""The 2nd Law: Unsustainable"". People accuse this song of being too much of an attempt to jump on the brostep bandwagon, but I think it\'s a very intriguing mix of genres. It starts off as a classical tune that wouldn\'t be out of place in a Zack Snyder film. There\'s an interesting monologue explaining the 2nd law of therodynamics. ""New energy cannot be created and if high energy  is being destroyed, an economy based on endless growth is..."" is suddenly cut off by a robot voice phonetically saying ""UN...SUSTAINABLE"", before the song explodes into a brostep breakdown. And despite my utter distaste of dubstep, the breakdown sounds awesome. For starters, the band actually plays the dubstep part on their instruments, as opposed to Skrillex and (insert generic step musician here), who does it all on a computer. Then a few bars of proggy symphonic rock pla, with Matt vocalizing, which manages to be very epic feeling. Then, after another monologue and epic drumming, the brostep part comes back in again.Next is ""Isolated System"". There\'s no dubstep here, and the song is more trance influenced than anything. The song loops the line from the previous song, ""In an isolated system, the entropy can only increase. The song is decidedly more trance influenced, and has a subdued. electro-trance beat  throughout. This is a truly unique track. It feels very subdued, and also like there\'s a lot of rage and energy dying to get out at the same time.The 2nd Law is very different from its predecessor. They\'re similar in the sense that they\'re both complete messes. But The Resistance is a mess that somehow manages to keep moving in a straight line, has a sense of direction and knows where it\'s headed. The 2nd Law is more like a six year old kid with ADHD telling a story. It constantly loses track of where it\'s going, and seems to not know what its goal really is. The album feels more like a compilation instead of an album- the tracks feel really out of sequence and like the band didn\'t seem to know what they wanted with the album.Problem is, it\'s too much of a Muse album, even for a Muse album. I really would like if they decided to do something outside their comfort zone. And it\'s not like they have to radically change, I mean, hell, my favourite band, Iron Maiden change all the time and yet still have that Iron Maiden sound. But they don\'t make it so that they just get lazy and take the classic Route.Yet, the album is still very listenable and there\'s a good number of standout tracks. Sure it\'s my 2nd least favourite of their albums (The Resistance takes that top spot), but it\'s enjoyable to an extent, and I\'d like to hear how the tracks sound live.', 'overall': 3.0, 'summary': ""It's not a good album or a bad album.

Both are not pop pap, well, they\'re quite pop, but they wouldn\'t be out of place on Return of Saturn. Looking Hot in particular has a catchy beat and ear worm chorus that will sure serve as a good concert singalong, but even then, I don\'t consider it to be anything special. One song, if I remember correctly, begins with a nice electric guitar riff... then suddenly this is blackballed by a thumping techno beat and synths, YUCK. Easy has absolutely pathetic lyrics and it sounds like they\'re whispering ""I\'m Madonna, I\'m Madonna, I\'m Madonna"" in the background.

And so, despite being a change, you need not worry folks, this is still a Coheed and Cambria album, and everything, from the Rush influences, to the punk-meets-metal ound, is still there. And it\'s clear that Coheed have changed their sound with every album, while still sounding like themselves. Except in 2010, they tried the electronic route for whatever reason, and the results were only disastrous. Thankfully they ditched the electronic elements this time around, and gave us a Straightforward rock album... For the most part.I\'ve been a fan of Coheed since Keeping Secrets, and I\'ve bought everything they\'ve ever put out since. I\'ve seen them live three times and even met them twice (one time being this year outside the venue where they were opening for my favourite band, Iron Maiden, while Claudio and Travis were going for a jog. I got an awesome picture with them!). So when I heard they were releasing a double album, I was excited. For a band like Coheed it seemed like a good idea, you know, with how epic their music is overall.And thankfully this album doesn\'t disappoint too much. If you\'re expecting typical Coheed tracks, well, you\'ve got them, with tracks like ""Goodnight, Fair Lady"", ""Vic the Butcher"", and ""Domino the Destitute"". However, Coheed have taken a bit of a softer direction with sings like ""Evagria the Faithful"", the rather Coldplay-esque ""The Afterman"" and Postal Service lite track ""Subtraction"".And, you know, it\'s not like either of these tracks are particularly bad. I actually kind of like ""The Afterman"". It\'s slow, but it\'s got some cool sounding repressing of energy and a rather ear wormish main guitar riff. Claudio\'s vocals are pretty nice on it as well. Subtraction is a decent track, if too short, but I like Claudio\'s rough and low vocals on the song too.So it may sound like I\'m praising the album for taking this kind of direction and in a way, I kind of am. I expect all my favourite bands to change. But the problem is... is this really the direction you want Coheed to take? I mean, for a band that have built their footing solely on proggish anthems like ""In Keeping Secrets of Silent Earth: 3"" and ""Everything Evil"", this is kind of an odd departure. Again, it\'s not like I don\'t expect bands to not change. But it feels like they\'re continuing to veer away from their prog edge and more into a pure straightforward pop-rock sound.So overall, for all its listliness, this is a decent album, and if anything, a good pop album. I mean, Coheed is still there, but there\'s lots tonappeal to the more pedestrian/casual listener. It\'s also a step up from YOBR and is recommended even as a starting point, as it\'s their most accessible yet.Oh, one more thing. Whose brilliant idea was the godawful packaging? The disc is held down to the cardboard by a piece of plastic. And the CD is held down tightly. I nearly snapped the disc in half trying to get it out from the case.

Really, they've made every album sound different since then, and you can hear it in the songs.I expect you guys would have figured that out with &#34;The Con&#34;, but come on, guys.

After they set the bar somewhat too high for themselves with Good Apollo, I'm Burning Star IV Vol. 1: From Fear Through the Eyes of Madness, people found themselves torn on the following album; people either liked or disliked the band's attempt to bring a more metal edge to their sound. The base got even more torn when they went the electronic route with Year of the Black Rainbow. Depending on who you may ask, that album is either one of their best or one of their worst. And while they didn't win any new fans with The Afterman: Ascension, at least the existing fan base took a fancy to it, and it's not hard to understand why. It does somewhat restore their classic sound and even has the 8 minute epic that would show up on their old albums, plus they replaced Chris &#34;I can't seem to go more than 10 seconds without doing another long drum fill&#34; Pennie with their old drummer, Joshua Eppard.Now, 4 months after the release of Ascension, the second part, Descension is finally out. Whether or not it was necessary to turn The Afterman into a seperately released double album is still a good question (though probably to make money or to give fans something to look forward to before Christmas), but that's not really the question I was asking myself when I heard this album- I was asking &#34;Why does this album seem so unfinished?&#34; It's not by any means a bad album, and I'd listen to it over Year of the Black Rainbow any day. But a lot of the songs seem like they had a lot of good ideas and rushed out the door with them.One big complaint I have about the album is the sound quality. The mastering of the album is atrocious. The problems are easily detectable right off the bat- the guitars are way too loud and everything else sounds like it was coming from the other room. At times Claudio's vocals are barely audible unless you turn it up to a deafening volume, and Josh's drums can't even be heard on some of the heavier tracks. There's zero headroom on any of the songs- even the vinyl sounds really bad (maybe that's the turquoise vinyl, the purple vinyl is transparent and transparent vinyls usually have good sound quality). Putting the CD in and bringing up some songs on Audacity brought some very obvious clipping to attention- some songs look like solid walls, even. Ouch.As for the songs- a lot of them sound like a bunch of demos. &#34;The Hard Sell&#34; begins nicely, and as soon as the guitar kicks in the song has sort of a The Wall edge that I like, but the &#34;Ooh ooh ooh&#34; parts really just aren't necessary and sort of kill the mood. The song doesn't really do anything noteworthy until the chorus, which, while catchy, won't really leave a lasting impression. &#34;Away We Go&#34; sounds like a poor man's &#34;Feathers&#34; and a 90s pop-rock song. It's really forgettable and could easily be a b-side. &#34;Gravity's Union&#34; sounds like the band is trying too hard to replicate the days of Keeping Secrets, but there is a glimmer of hope- at the 4:45 mark, the song finally gets entertaining and gives us a nice fade out. Sadly, we had to wait until the 4:45 mark for that last part, and that's never a good sign. &#34;Dark Side of Me&#34; is an agonizingly dull power ballad and while Claudio's vocals sound nice on it, it feels really out of place on the whole album. And I appreciate the band trying to end the album on a good note with &#34;2's My Favorite 1&#34;, which is eerily reminiscent of &#34;God Send Conspirator&#34; and sounds like the closing credits to a good movie, but it's over too quickly and that pointless interlude at the end (it sounds like they're trying too hard to end the album in a similar note as that scary piano part at the end of said example) doesn't help matters.But, there are some good songs too. &#34;Sentry the Defiant&#34; is a good example, and I remember hearing it when they opened for Iron Maiden earlier this year (it sounded better there, obviously). The song brings back the metal sound that No World brought to the table and starts off the album on a good note. &#34;Number City&#34; is fun, catchy, and very reminiscent of No Doubt with its ska punk sound. It's a very unexpected move from the band and I'd love to hear them play with that sound in the future. And despite what some people say here, I really like &#34;Iron Fist&#34;. It has a nice country sound to it and the slide guitar passages also add a real 70s ballad twist. It is a nice example of the band trying new things and really succeeding. I'd definitely not be surprised if it became a concert staple, that's for sure.Coheed's latest album will ultimately divide fans, and it won't win any new fans either. If you don't like the band's more experimental route, well, it won't change your kind. For me though, it's really disappointing because there so many parts on the album that tease to the fact that it my get better, and very few of the songs have that &#34;start-to-finish&#34; vibe... they sound very rushed and unfinished. If this were another band perhaps I wouldn't be so nitpicky, but this album comes from a band that are so much more capable than what's offered here."", 'overall': 2.0, 'summary': 'A frustratingly give-and-take and just plain average effort from a band clearly capable of so much more.', 'unixReviewTime': 1360713600, 'reviewTime': '02 13, 2013'}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

HA HA... all yuk-yuks aside, though, on with it.Back in the late \'80s/early \'90s, one of the hottest garage bands in Southern California was a little trio called Sublime, featuring Brad Nowell, Eric Wilson, and Bud Gaugh. They were playing parties, colleges, etc. In 1992, they released their first breakthrough disc, 40 Oz. To Freedom, which is considered by many (including me) to be their finest hour. After 1994\'s Robbin The Hood, they finally released their mainstream hit, their self-titled album, ""Sublime"". Sadly, it was released two weeks after Brad\'s death from heroin. May his talented soul rest in peace. But we\'ll always have the music...I\'ve owned this one since sixth or seventh grade, and it\'s just a great, great album. Seriously. It combines ska, punk, reggae, hip-hop, dub, etc. into one flavorful mix full of SoCal flavor. Each song is a tale of life in Long Beach, in a way only Brad could tell. Everybody knows the hits ""Santeria"", ""What I Got"", and ""Wrong Way"" (all great songs, despite excessive airplay). But we also get the raging rocker ""Same In The End"", the promiscuous ""Caress Me Down"", the easy-going ""Doin\' Time"", the trippy ""Under My Voodoo"", etc. No wonder this one\'s so popular.If you like bands like 311, Reel Big Fish, etc. then check this one out (along with 40 Oz. and the rest).

Nothing prophetic, nothing that urges the listener to wake up, just more feel-good reggae, punk, ska, and groovy anthems than you can shake a salsa shark at.This is one of the essentials of the 1990\'s. If you like good music, you NEED this in your collection. Period. End of sentence. The soulful, and yet hooky rythyms of the SoCal threesome make you feel good all over. Put it on, and let Brad Nowell take you away to a better place.Incidentally, don\'t be put off by the title ""Date Rape"". The song is actually about poetic justice (listen for yourself).

Brandy has gone back to her previous sound; which is working with long time producer Rodney Jerkins.  The album reminds me of ""Full Moon"" and ""Never Say Never"".  Aphrodisiac was a good album also, but it was a different sound for Brandy.  I thought that Brandy and Timberland didn\'t make a good combination.  One thing I can say about Aphrodisiac is that I think it was Brandy\'s best album vocally.  Some producers and artists are meant to make great music together and also make up a dynamic team.

Then again, every female artist is now being compared to Beyonce. Why???  Beyonce is a great entertainer and she dazzles on stage, but she\'s not the first and she\'s won\'t be the last.

Oh Yes - (4.5/5) - This beat uses a Supreme sample. But its one of those Dipset type beat. Still a good beat and a catchy song. Hook is ok. Nothing great but not bad at all.4. Shottas feat. Cam'ron and Sizzla - (5/5) - Love this beat by the Heatmakers. One of those pump up songs about shots of any kind if you know what I mean. Hook is catchy.5. Clockwork - (4.5/5) - I love this beat. Didnt like it at first but I grew into it. Hook is catchy. Lyrics are ok.6. Kill Em feat. Cam'ron - (4.5/5) - Love this song with the typical type Cam'ron verse. Catchy hook and Juelz does a good job with his verse. Good violin type beat.7. This Is Me - (5/5) - Second favorite song on the album. Love the beat and the slow flow he uses on this song. Hook is good too.8. Make It Work For You feat. Lil Wayne and Young Jeezy - (4.5/5) - All these of these guys spit good verses. One of those songs about cooking crack I think. Catchy hook and decent beat.9. Whatever U Wanna Call It feat. Hell Rell - (5/5) - Damn I love this beat. Both Juelz and Rell spit fire on this track.10. Gangsta Sh*t - (4/5) - Great beat. Another gangsta song. Nothing really special but its still a good song.11. Lil Boy Fresh - (5/5) - Great beat and Juelz displays his storytelling abilities about the hustle game.12. Good Times - (5/5) - Another emotional song about the good days. Going back into the past on this one over a soulful beat and a really good hook.13. Freaky - (4/5) - I think the name says it all. Good beat and ok lyrics.14. Murda Murda feat. Cam'ron - (5/5) - 3rd favorite song on the album. I dont know about you but this hook just really hypes me up. Cam'ron spit a great verse. I love this beat which samples They Call It Murda (Tony Yayo song isnt it?)15. Gone - (5/5) - Another storytelling track. Good beat and an interesting hook. Actually the hook makes this song WAY BETTER.16. Kid Is Back - (5/5) - His nephew Ja is singing the hook. Lol its good. This song is good and a catchy beat. He and his nephew do a good job on this song. They are a good team. I knew Ja would be back to do a song since the intro was so good. Juelz lyrics are tongue twisting and he tries a new flow.17. Changes feat. Razah - (4/5) - Beat isnt that good. Probably the worse song on the album. Not bad but nothing special. Seems like a filler.18. I Am Crack - (4.5/5) - Great rock beat and a catchy hook.19. There It Go (Whistle Song) - (4.5/5) - Catchy dance song. Everyone has heard this song and its been playing everywhere I live way before the CD comes out. Catchy hook and beat.20. Violence feat. Bezel - (4/5) - This song would have been better on Jay Bezel's CD. Its ok but nothing special to me.21. Daddy - (6/5) - Favorite song on the albums. Probably one of his most heart felt songs next to Who Am I on the Dipset Immunity album. Just him talking to his newborn son about life and his new experience as a father. Great beat and lyrics.22.

""Get Your Grind On"" blew me away. Killa chorus by Freeway, Biggie shines really hard on this song spitting 2 verses, beat is excellent. Fat Joes verse was too long to me. He was recycling some stuff but it was aight. Big Pun is still one of my top 4. ""Living The Life"" was ok. Nothing special. ""1970 Something"" is a great song. My favorite song on the CD.

""Im Wit Whateva"" has a great beat but Lil Wayne and Biggie are the only standouts. Juelz Santana doesnt even give a good verse on this and Jim Jones just sucks. Luckily he didnt drop a verse but I gotta admit that chorus is catchy. Beef 2005 is just another Whats Beef just with Mobb Deep. The original is way better. ""Hustlas Story"" is pretty good. But what makes me wonder is why is Big Gee (Boyz N Da Hood member) on here and not Black Rob? Black Ron dedicated a whole song to Biggie...I mean he deserved to be on this CD more than Big Gee. Akon added some Senegal flavor and Scarface finished it off. Still the king of the south lol. ""Breaking Old Habits"" is aight. Why the hell is Slim Thug on this CD?

This is the best Twista album in a decade and one of the best albums of the year.', 'overall': 5.0, 'summary': ""Chi-Town's finest comes with his second classic in a decade"", 'unixReviewTime': 1190073600, 'reviewTime': '09 18, 2007'}","{'reviewerID': 'A398Z0ZU011ILU', 'asin': 'B00192M9FC', 'reviewerName': 'Viper', 'helpful': [2, 6], 'reviewText': ""After being incredibly disappointed by Encore, I've waited for the return of the old Eminem. The dark, twisted, shock rapper that we all knew and loved who thumbed his nose at parents and society. Well my friends he's back! Gone are the songs about his daughter, Bush, Michael Jackson and his beef with Benzino. This is dark, twisted stuff that isn't for the faint of heart much like his first two albums. Expect rape jokes, twisted fetishes, brutal violence, drugs, and relentless celebrity bashing on this CD. And oh yeah his lyrcism is much better too. It seems like Eminem shines the most when he tries to be the twisted shock rapper, but then again that's what made him famous ten years ago. If you got a strong stomach pick this CD up cuz it's probably on the way to being one of the year's best albums."", 'overall': 5.0, 'summary': 'Slim Shady is back!', 'unixReviewTime': 1245283200, 'reviewTime': '06 18, 2009'}",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
