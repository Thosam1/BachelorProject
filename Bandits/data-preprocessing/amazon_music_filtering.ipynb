But people with open minds could find there\\'s some beautiful melodies and harmonies as well as lively, upbeat tunes that are a joy to put on. I find the Memory of Trees to be one of her most consistent albums; plus it helps it has probably one of my top 5 favorite songs ever.The Memory of Trees: Like all of her records (except the recent Amarantine), the albums open with a wordless instrumental and this album\\'s title track is probably my favorite with gentle piano arpeggios and a beautiful vocal track. I always like the sparse use of percussion. 9/10Anywhere Is: The lively single; it\\'s actually a good sing-along with staccato beats and a great chorus. It\\'s also a perfect length since it\\'s under 3 minutes so whereas some pop songs drag after awhile, this one hooks you in then lets you go, leaving you wanting more. 9/10Pax Deorum: Another album, another ominous Latin-sung piece. The music sounds like something you\\'d hear in enemy territories in video games while Enya gives a low-voice, almost monotone performance over the music. Slightly repetitive until a 2nd higher voice comes in but the piece hits its stride halfway with a gorgeous bridge. 8/10Athair Ar Nearmh: There\\'s some songs she does where it\\'s more about the song itself rather than a poppy, catchy quality a la Only Time and this song\\'s similar. Another ballad with some of her best singing, it\\'s a more low-key track but it\\'s also one of the album highlights. 8.5/10From Where I Am: Another instrumental; this one\\'s a more piano-based piece that would be a nice song to learn for all pianists out there since it\\'s not technically complex or fast but it\\'s pleasant to listen to. 7.5/10China Roses: There\\'s only a handful of songs I could have on repeat and never get sick of them and this is one of them. Everything from the vocals and background instrumentation, the lyrics and not to mention one of the most relaxing and almost tranquil ending codas I\\'ve ever heard, this is definately my favorite song on here, plus her whole career even. 15/10Hope Has a Place: For me, any song after China Roses will probably suffer a tad but this song doesn\\'t do much for me. Granted, her vocals are as great as always and the song has a nice, relaxing mood but either this kind of track is too familiar (a kind of Athair part 2 if you will) or it\\'s just not as memorable. 7/10Tea-House Moon: Very oriental in its instruments, it\\'s another wordless song although it\\'s more enjoyable than From Where I Am is, mainly because the melodies are more memorable and it\\'s a bit more song-oriented. It\\'s different but strangely likable. 8/10Once You Had Gold: We\\'re getting into the album\\'s final stretch and the problem is that with this one, it\\'s a more quieter affair as you can feel the album almost winding down. With Enya\\'s more higher vocals (for some reason, reminiscent of her Silent Night rendition), it\\'s another beautiful track but it\\'s also a bit...same-y? 8/10La Sonadora: Spanish lyrics for once, it\\'s another slower paced track complete with \"aahs\" for background vocals and synths but again, the album could\\'ve benefited from a more perkier track. I do like what it does at the halfway point and gives the track a little boost. 7.5/10On My Way Home: A church organ opens the track and with a more bouncy synth, you\\'d think it was a bit more upbeat. While it\\'s not as lively as her vocals on Anywhere Is, it does give the album a bit more memorable closer, especially when the chorus comes where the track gets more fuller in its arrangements. 9/10While A Day Without Rain or Watermark is usually marked as one of her best (probably because her big hits Only Time and Orinoco Flow were on them), I find the Memory of Trees a more likable album and despite a lack of more upbeat tracks, it\\'s still one of her finest outings.', 'overall': 4.0, 'summary': '4.5; music to dream to', 'unixReviewTime': 1200528000, 'reviewTime': '01 17, 2008'}]\n",

Clearly, it's a song about pain - about not being able to commit oneself to someone one wants to love.  (Or something like that).

And the album ends with another humorous little jig.  It shows that cynicism and humor are connected.

The natural quality of it enhances the impression of her as just \"someone I know who writes beautiful poetry and makes up incredible melodies.\"  She hits some nice high notes, but overall, she sounds just a little less trained than some other singers you hear.  (In my opinion.)  But that\\'s part of her style!  That\\'s part of the reason her personality comes through so strongly.  Because we can HEAR HER HEART in her voice.  It hasn\\'t been trained to cold perfection.FOR THE ROSES is a combination of folk and 60s-style pop.  Sometimes it moves along like a comfortable train, easing from one song to the next.  Many of the pieces are easygoing melodies, so mild that the complicated, intelligent lyrics come as a surprise.  But a couple of the songs are heart-stopping or contain heart-stopping moments.THE BLONDE IN THE BLEACHERS starts off as a mild, easygoing melody, but suddenly, at the end, it completely turns - Joni seems to turn to the audience, break out of the song, and suddenly sing some surprising lyrics RIGHT AT YOU.LET THE WIND CARRY ME is a heartfelt confession/ballad that you will want to play over and over and over.  It is beautiful to the core.The album as a whole is complicated - both lyrically and melodically.  Like a great novel, it needs to be opened slowly, appreciated in morsels and then gradually as a whole.Most die-hard Joni fans I know say that this isn\\'t their number one favorite album.  But it\\'s in everybody\\'s top three without exception.

But people with open minds could find there\\'s some beautiful melodies and harmonies as well as lively, upbeat tunes that are a joy to put on. I find the Memory of Trees to be one of her most consistent albums; plus it helps it has probably one of my top 5 favorite songs ever.The Memory of Trees: Like all of her records (except the recent Amarantine), the albums open with a wordless instrumental and this album\\'s title track is probably my favorite with gentle piano arpeggios and a beautiful vocal track. I always like the sparse use of percussion. 9/10Anywhere Is: The lively single; it\\'s actually a good sing-along with staccato beats and a great chorus. It\\'s also a perfect length since it\\'s under 3 minutes so whereas some pop songs drag after awhile, this one hooks you in then lets you go, leaving you wanting more. 9/10Pax Deorum: Another album, another ominous Latin-sung piece. The music sounds like something you\\'d hear in enemy territories in video games while Enya gives a low-voice, almost monotone performance over the music. Slightly repetitive until a 2nd higher voice comes in but the piece hits its stride halfway with a gorgeous bridge. 8/10Athair Ar Nearmh: There\\'s some songs she does where it\\'s more about the song itself rather than a poppy, catchy quality a la Only Time and this song\\'s similar. Another ballad with some of her best singing, it\\'s a more low-key track but it\\'s also one of the album highlights. 8.5/10From Where I Am: Another instrumental; this one\\'s a more piano-based piece that would be a nice song to learn for all pianists out there since it\\'s not technically complex or fast but it\\'s pleasant to listen to. 7.5/10China Roses: There\\'s only a handful of songs I could have on repeat and never get sick of them and this is one of them. Everything from the vocals and background instrumentation, the lyrics and not to mention one of the most relaxing and almost tranquil ending codas I\\'ve ever heard, this is definately my favorite song on here, plus her whole career even. 15/10Hope Has a Place: For me, any song after China Roses will probably suffer a tad but this song doesn\\'t do much for me. Granted, her vocals are as great as always and the song has a nice, relaxing mood but either this kind of track is too familiar (a kind of Athair part 2 if you will) or it\\'s just not as memorable. 7/10Tea-House Moon: Very oriental in its instruments, it\\'s another wordless song although it\\'s more enjoyable than From Where I Am is, mainly because the melodies are more memorable and it\\'s a bit more song-oriented. It\\'s different but strangely likable. 8/10Once You Had Gold: We\\'re getting into the album\\'s final stretch and the problem is that with this one, it\\'s a more quieter affair as you can feel the album almost winding down. With Enya\\'s more higher vocals (for some reason, reminiscent of her Silent Night rendition), it\\'s another beautiful track but it\\'s also a bit...same-y? 8/10La Sonadora: Spanish lyrics for once, it\\'s another slower paced track complete with \"aahs\" for background vocals and synths but again, the album could\\'ve benefited from a more perkier track. I do like what it does at the halfway point and gives the track a little boost. 7.5/10On My Way Home: A church organ opens the track and with a more bouncy synth, you\\'d think it was a bit more upbeat. While it\\'s not as lively as her vocals on Anywhere Is, it does give the album a bit more memorable closer, especially when the chorus comes where the track gets more fuller in its arrangements. 9/10While A Day Without Rain or Watermark is usually marked as one of her best (probably because her big hits Only Time and Orinoco Flow were on them), I find the Memory of Trees a more likable album and despite a lack of more upbeat tracks, it\\'s still one of her finest outings.', 'overall': 4.0, 'summary': '4.5; music to dream to', 'unixReviewTime': 1200528000, 'reviewTime': '01 17, 2008'}, {'reviewerID': 'A1AISPOIIHTHXX', 'asin': 'B000003TAW', 'reviewerName': 'Cloud \"...\"', 'helpful': [0, 1], 'reviewText': 'Frontman Rivers Cuomo to a lot of people can be a bit of an oddball. He\\'s extremely shy, rarely saying a whole lot in interviews, has those trademark nerd-like glasses and doesn\\'t seem like a rock star. However, like Brian Wilson, underneath all that is someone is very capable of delivering an infectious pop song with heart-on-sleeve type lyrics.My Name is Jonas: It\\'s probably my 2nd favorite album opener besides Where the Streets Have No Name. A simple fingerpicked acoustic intro before the band comes crashing than back again and it keeps going. Lyrically, I have no idea. 10/10No One Else: Probably the most infectious song about a controlling boyfriend. My favorite parts oddly enough are just before the chorus where he either goes \"watch her, watch her watch her watch her!\" or \"it\\'s a hey hey hey hey!\", I don\\'t know, just can\\'t help singing along to that part. 9/10The World Has Turned and Left Me Here: A very sad lyrically song about love lost and wanting it back. Favorite part is definately the end where there\\'s 2 vocals going on at once until they merge going \"do you believe what I sing now?\". 8/10Buddy Holly: Probably Weezer\\'s signature song, it\\'s short, catchy and had a great video. It\\'s quite fun to play on guitar too and there\\'s gonna be some kind of vocal that you\\'ll like singing too. 9/10Undone(The Sweater Song): The other wellknown song but to be honest it\\'s not a favorite. It starts with what\\'s possibly the catchiest arpeggio Weezer has until a quiet verse and the chorus comes in. It\\'s not a fav cause of the \"freak out\" at the end where they kind of go nuts. 7.5/10Surf Wax America: It\\'s quite neat looking at this: a jangly guitar line worthy of the Byrds, punky verses and choruses and a bridge with vocal harmonies all fit perfectly together. Lyrically, it\\'s about alcoholism I hear. 8/10Say It Ain\\'t So: 3rd single and another great one, even if I can\\'t really listen to it anymore due to overplayedness. Chorus is definately a highlight, bringing out the air guitarist in you. 8/10In the Garage: To be honest, I kind of hate this song. It\\'s probably the only song of theirs that I actually skip. Lyrically it brings out the inner nerd in people with guys jamming with Kiss posters around and playing Dungeons and Dragons. 6/10Holiday: It\\'s a kind of interesting song. It\\'s certainly catchy with big riffs but it may not have that lasting appeal to some but to me it\\'s a nice listen. Quite interesting is its bridge where like Surf Wax America they introduce this section that oddly works out even with its quirkiness, here it sounds like blues-y bass meets a barbershop quartet.Only in Dreams: Ah, this song. Dreams of dancing with the girl of our dreams only to realize it\\'s only dreams. A lot of people said Weezer should write another type of these and they should. After about 4-5 minutes, there\\'s this long awesome crescendo buildup that goes into this big solo before coming back down. It\\'s long but oh so great. 10/10One misstep, a on-the-fence song on album with 8 others that are great listens.

Musically, this record is the band at some of their most aggressive and loudest which makes for some big rock moments but sometimes very little in terms of actual songs.Rich: An intro that sets the tone: high-fretted guitar notes, big drum part, Karen O\\'s shift from singing to throaty yells and loud distorted riffs. It\\'s certainly an interesting song and the more I listen, the more I like so good on them. 8/10Date With the Night: Very groove-based song and one of the more memorable ones. However I will say the \"choke, choke!\" chorus where it gets loud, very distorted and a lot more aggro doesn\\'t sit well with me. The song\\'s got a great energy but whenever that part hits, for some reason I don\\'t care for it. 7.5/10Man: Another energetic song and all and again like Date With the Night, it\\'s got cool riffs but the problem is that it\\'s ridiculously short at 1:50. Good length or underwritten? Hm. 7/10Tick: Another really short one (strangely at 1:50 as well) and it\\'s certainly raucous and it\\'s actually funny, if only for Karen\\'s increasingly frenzied singing the more the thing goes on. It leaves an impression but then it goes away just as fast. 7/10Black Tongue: Now this one I like since it\\'s got cool riffs and it\\'s actually quite singable and catchy as well and Karen certainly shows quite a lot of attitude on this, which is probably why I like it more. 8/10Pin: For some reason the intro reminds me of that AC/DC song but oh well. Strangely it seems like the more the record progresses the better it gets in terms of melodies. Still not up to the standards of songs later on the record but it works. 7.5/10Cold Light: Somewhat underdeveloped for me and one I barely return to all that much. Not that there\\'s anything wrong with it in terms of structure and whatnot but it just doesn\\'t grab me. 6/10No No No: A really out there song with lots of big fat guitar riffs and noisy parts though it\\'s somewhat lacking in singable melodies but then it all of a sudden quiets down for some space-y feedback, strange guitar noises and more jam-like approach. Might polarize some. 7.5/10Maps: Now we get into the good stuff, and by that I mean the tracks that are exceptionally great. We start off with Maps, arguably their \"signature tune\" with Karen O\\'s emotive delivery having all the power in her voice by not overdoing it, or as we can say, the Celine Dion approach. Definitely worth a listen if you haven\\'t already. 9/10Y Control: Cool guitar intro at the start and all the big riffs really help the song become a really entertaining track and seems like they saved some of their better for last. And it\\'s actually a decent length too so yay. 9/10Modern Romance: A somewhat depressing song with a very bassy but melancholy guitar riff and Karen\\'s vocals at some of their more relaxed on the record. It\\'s something they\\'d explore a bit more with later records, mainly It\\'s Blitz so it\\'s great to see them not just do aggressive numbers the whole time. Funny thing is that it\\'s only 3 minutes and some long than there\\'s a secret track at the end so it\\'s shorter than it appears. 9/10From a song-by-song standpoint, Fever to Tell isn\\'t a very strong record until the home stretch but if you just leave it on and try not to look at certain songs individually it works quite well but the band will improve on each listen so this makes this a record that\\'s worth checking out though not one of their more consistent ones.', 'overall': 4.0, 'summary': 'This is the \"aggressive\" record of the band', 'unixReviewTime': 1241827200, 'reviewTime': '05 9, 2009'}, {'reviewerID': 'A1AISPOIIHTHXX', 'asin': 'B0002MSCBK', 'reviewerName': 'Cloud \"...\"', 'helpful': [10, 11], 'reviewText': 'Many groups in Canada simply do not get the recognition they should. For every talented bands that make it south of the border like Rush or Guess Who, there\\'s untalented ones like Avril Lavigne or Sum 41. Tegan and Sara are a pretty well-known group in Canada and have very little recognition in the States, which is too bad. They\\'ve released 3 records so far that have been excellent and they\\'re still not well-known. Oh well, guess we can rub it in some american\\'s face that they have to settle with Good Charlotte while we have Tegan and Sara and many others.You Wouldn\\'t Like Me(Tegan): Like Lennon and McCartney, each girl sings the song they\\'ve written instead of having a chief songwriter. This is a Tegan song and probably her best on here. A driving rhythm and an incredibly catchy melody make it a great opener. 10/10Take Me Anywhere(Tegan): A nice upbeat song, catchy chorus, and some nice background vocals. There\\'s a 2nd guitar near the end but I can barely hear it but that\\'s ok. 9/10I Bet It Stung(Sara): Definately Sara\\'s best on here. An incredibly driving rhythm makes it an almost epic-like quality for a 3 minute song. One complaint is her lead vocal sounds strange like when you talk into a fan but that\\'s a minor complaint for what would be a great single if they made it one. 10/10I Know I Know I Know(Tegan): It\\'s a lot of people\\'s favorite but maybe after the last song, it doesn\\'t hit much but it\\'s still good. I like the 2nd guitar during the pre-chorus and the end though, very effective. 8/10Where Does the Good Go(Tegan): The bassline sounds funny but it\\'s another good song where both girls sing parts together rather than separately or one\\'s mixed a bit low in the background. Love the chorus. 8/10Downtown(Sara): Finally we get to a Sara song and again it\\'s a good one. Very sad-sounding chord progression with a quite catchy chorus. And is it me, or does the song seem to be about oral sex? Just wondering. 9/10I Won\\'t Be Left(Tegan): Back to Tegan and opens with an almost punk-like guitar opening before the acoustic comes in. The background vocals are quite effective too. 8/10Walking With a Ghost(Sara): The first single and the guitar melody is so catchy you probably can\\'t help but pick up one and play along if you have one. It even has synth from Matt Sharp(ex-Weezer bassist). It\\'s a bit repetitive but it sounds better like that to me. 8/10So Jealous(Sara): Starts off with some interesting synth before the acoustic comes in and then explodes into the chorus when everyone comes in. 9/10Speak Slow(Tegan): The second single and a very upbeat rock song.  Great rhythm and a catchy chorus with it\\'s \"ah-ahh!\" part at the end. Probably my favorite bridge on the record. 9/10Wake Up Exhausted(Tegan): If it seems the songs are more lopsided to Tegan, they are, she has 8, Sara has 6. Oh well. Another standout with a weird fuzzy guitar after the verses. The \"are you alright?\" line for some reason I just like listening to. 9/10We Didn\\'t Do It(Sara): The opening guitar line almost reminds me of Walking With a Ghost but must be me. While the verses seem kind of poppy, the chorus is probably my favorite. The synthline combined with the rest of the instruments makes for a great chorus. If only the verses didn\\'t seem lopsided. 8/10Fix You Up(Tegan): The last Tegan song and it\\'s pretty good with my favorite part being the chorus where both girls sing then later when it\\'s repeated but it\\'s full band. Probably my second favorite Tegan song on here after You Wouldn\\'t Like Me. 9/10I Can\\'t Take It(Sara): The last Sara and album closer and to be honest, it\\'s probably my least favorite although it\\'s nicely sung. They should\\'ve switched this with Fix You Up and it would\\'ve been a better closer.Tegan and Sara are in that group \"talented unknowns\": they have the capability to be bigger than they are but for some reason people focus elsewhere(and I\\'m sure you know plenty of examples of this).

Now this is not a terrible record by any means, I mean it sure beats anything those pop punk dudes churn out but this isn\\'t a record with huge commercial appeal like Elephant. Probably even less so.The album starts out promisingly enough with \"Blue Orchid\" with Jack\\'s octave-affected guitar doing a catchy riff and singing something about orchids and how old someone is. I don\\'t know but it\\'s a great opening track. Next is the totally weird the Nurse which is led by a dulcimer and it\\'s just an odd track, not necessarily bad just...odd. We do have other songs like My Doorbell or the Denial Twist which are big piano-based numbers and while catchy, you kind of miss the guitars for some reason.The rest are separated into 2 types of songs. First half is the acoustic/piano stuff like Forever For Her (Is Over For Me) and White Moon with the former being one of his better ballads while the latter has a nice piano part yet it suffers from not really having a sense of melody to latch onto outside of the piano. Take, Take, Take which is a more upbeat acoustic song is alright but the chorus is just irritating. Afterwards we get what\\'s probably this album\\'s We\\'re Going to be Friends with a weirdly upbeat As Ugly as I Am which is actually quite fun to play as well as listen to.The other type is the big blues rock numbers akin to Ball and Biscuit from Elephant. Problem is outside of the main riff, Instinct Blues just feels way too long and is kind of uninteresting to listen. Red Rain is way better which shifts from soft slide guitar to big loud slide chords a la Seven Nation Army. The album ends with the soft piano I Get Lonely (But I Ain\\'t That Lonely Yet). It seems like an appropriate closer given the material on here and it\\'s a nice song to listen to but you probably won\\'t have it on repeat much.You got to give them credit for at least trying to shake things up a bit.

From the musicianship to the songwriting to the vocals, they're just plain bad and why they're still around is anyone's guess. The third is where everyone wants to be: the greats that can produce stellar records either as soon as they start or they eventually will. The second is where Silversun Pickups are and where a lot of bands tend to start: many aspects are strong but they have a tendency to do things that prevents them from being a completely solid band. Carnavas has songs that lack something that makes it a completely good song but the basic core of it is enough to warrant a listen.Melatonin: A good choice for an opener as it introduces the sound early on which is very buzzy. Guitarist/vocalist Brian Aubert shares vocals with bassist Nikki Mossinger and it makes for an intriguing opener. Only thing knocking it down a bit is that the vocals are hard to understand. 8/10Well Thought Out Twinkles: A catchy riff starts off the song but weirdly there's something slightly off, like it's missing a memorable vocal melody or catchy chorus but as it is, it's just a good rock song without a lot to latch onto, other than the riffs. 7.5/10Checkered Floor: Ah, now we're getting somewhere. Starts off as a slightly mid-tempo rock song with a catchy guitar lead line before it goes into a memorable chorus. It's definately to me one of the highlights on the whole album. 9/10Little Lover's So Polite: The other album highlight. A simplistic-yet-effective guitar line starts it off before we get a super fuzzy song about who knows what. Mossinger adds some dynamics to the song by lending her voice but the shift is slightly too abrupt for me. Vocals are fine but musically it doesn't quite gel. 8/10Future Foe Scenarios: Despite the fact it drags a bit, this is definately one of the better songs on here from Aubert's raw vocals to the super catchy fuzzy (be prepared to have a lot of fuzzyness on the album) guitar riff, it's evidence that this isn't a band with throwaway songs. 8.5/10Waste it On: Starts off as being a bass-driven atmospheric number before it picks up the pace and gets more energetic. However it takes a little while to get going but once it does, it's quite good. 7.5/10Lazy Eye: Why this was a single, I don't know. Now the guitar riffs are super catchy and at one point the song kind of explodes and gets more explosive but there's barely any catchy melodies/choruses and the song drags on way too much and you wonder why the 4 minute radio edit wasn't used since it's much better. 7.5/10Rusted Wheel: It starts off promising like most of the songs on the album, they're either slightly underdeveloped or they drag a bit. Melodies are there but for some reason, something seems lacking to me with the whole song like it didn't click despite repeated listens. 7/10Dream at Tempo 119: Another album highlight. I love the verse riff, the lead guitar line under the chorus and the chorus itself, this is how many of the songs on the album should've been: catchy and yet it still rocks. I don't need pop melodies everytime but I at least need something that makes the song stand out and luckily many things stand out with this song. 9/10Three Seed: A more low-key song with some nice ambience created and the whole thing has a very nice vibe to it all. It probably won't be many people's favorite but when you listen to it, you think that it's pretty good. 7.5/10Common Reactor: Another buzzy song that again has some compelling elements to it such as its chorus and would've been great if the band would just trim out the fat. What would've been a great 4 minute closer becomes a slightly meandering 6 minute one with long periods of noise at the end. But I still find it a highlight so it's not like most of the other songs. 8.5/10If the band can hook up with the right producer and develop the songs more, this could definately be a great band. But at this point, it's a promising debut and one that should have even better results on 2nd album. Oh by the way, the whole Smashing Pumpkins thing? I never remotely heard any similarities until I looked at other reviews.

Big riffs and chords, this whole record feels like Rush circa Counterparts and this would\\'ve fit right along there. Weird solo though. 8.5/10Armor and Sword: Seems like an epic in the vein of Natural Science or Jacob\\'s Ladder. Great intro with a neat riff involving chords, harmonics and arpeggios. It drags ever so slightly since it kind of just keeps going without a change in the musicianship like Xanadu did but oh well. 9/10Workin\\' Them Angels: Remember people said Peaceable Kingdom sounded like Half the World? This reminds me of that too but it\\'s still a likable track and is another one of the upbeat, catchy tracks. Originally I didn\\'t like it (chorus, mainly) but it grew on me. 8.5/10The Larger Bowl: It\\'s quite an accessible track and radio could potentially embrace it if it\\'s a single with an radio friendly hook but strangely, I wasn\\'t a big fan of it. Maybe it just needs to grow on me more. 7.5/10Spindrift: Eerie arpeggios start the track before delving into an evil, onimous riff and the whole thing has a very compelling feeling to it. Reminds me of Witch Hunt or Double Agent in its tone. A very grandiose rocker. 8.5/10The Main Monkey Business: Possibly to make up for the lack of an instrumental on Vapor Trails, this is the first of 3. While it won\\'t send guitarists to the woodshop like YYZ did, this is probably their best instrumental in years. Many changes and great interplay including some synth backing, this is an album highlight. 9.5/10The Way the Wind Blows: Even though it\\'s a bit more rockier and blues-y, it always reminds me of a more faster Nobody\\'s Hero or Resist. It\\'s also one of the album\\'s greater songs with a fast tempo and an anthemic chorus. If you want to test the waters, this is a good track to listen to first. 9/10Hope: Now this will either scare away or get guitarists ramped up. A Middle-Eastern flavored instrumental acoustic piece courtesy of \"Lerxst Lifeson\", it\\'s nice to listen to but other than guitarists, most will probably skip it. 8/10Faithless: The record as a whole has the theme of faith in things and what can change it and this song is like the basic idea of that. Musically though, a mid-tempo number with plenty of progness going on,  it\\'s alright but again, it didn\\'t catch me on first listen and after a few, it still hasn\\'t. 7.5/10Bravest Face: I\\'m not a big fan of the verses but everything else works perfectly. Many musical changes from acoustics to patented Lifeson arpeggios and a great chorus, this is one of those songs on the record where you\\'ll keep coming back to it as you keep listening. 9/10Good News First: Musically, it\\'s actually quite an interesting listen. It\\'s just the rest of it as a song works at times but not consistently. It seems to be a song that almost lacks a strong enough hook which many Rush songs usually have. 7/10Malignant Narcissism: The title (which has shades of \"an exercise in self-indulgence\" that La Villa Strangiato had, is taken from Team America: World Police and even appears in the song itself. The last of the instrumentals and is probably the more straightforward of them, like Where\\'s My Thing. Geddy Lee is all over the place with his bass here. 9/10We Hold On: Like Everyday Glory, it ends the record on a kind of uplifting note. It\\'s not quite fullblown optimism, just a more hopeful one. It\\'s also one of the more likable songs on the record and in a warped world, could even be a song radio could embrace but since they always look for Tom Sawyer part II, it wouldn\\'t do anything which is too bad. 9/10I think people by now know they\\'re not going to do another Moving Pictures or Permanent Waves. Whereas those albums had more a feeling of songs intended to be chockful of hooks, these are more slow burner songs that eventually get into your head. A good handful from here will get into your head and it\\'s nice to see the production lend itself to the songs.', 'overall': 5.0, 'summary': 'A welcome addition to an impressive catalog', 'unixReviewTime': 1178323200, 'reviewTime': '05 5, 2007'}, {'reviewerID': 'A1AISPOIIHTHXX', 'asin': 'B000OYC3J8', 'reviewerName': 'Cloud \"...\"', 'helpful': [0, 1], 'reviewText': 'The White Stripes originally were a band that I kind of liked but not really. I always saw them as the better band in that \"The\" garage rock scene from the Vines to the Hives but at times many of the songs on album releases were more about them rocking out but not really delivering anything in terms of melody. Sure it\\'s fun to just play but it would be nice if we caught that energy too. After the difficult-to-get-into album Get Behind Me Satan, the White Stripes make a return with a record that\\'s as accessible as anything they\\'ve done.The album starts out with Icky Thump which follows the tradition that Seven Nation Army and Blue Orchid set which is led by a catchy rock riff, particularly the \"chorus\". Jack sings lyrics concerning an encounter with a Mexican prostitute and while I\\'m not a fan of the solo at the end, it\\'s still a great opener. The next song is another enjoyable one with You Don\\'t Know What Love is. Big loud blues-y rocker, it\\'s just a fun song to listen and it even has a chorus you can sing along to. What was probably meant to be the Ball and Biscuit of the album (a more blues-improv number where Jack can let his guitar flag fly), 300 M.P.H Torrential Outpour Blues just kind of meanders.A strange contender for the best song on the album, Conquest has Mexican horns, charging guitars and probably Jack\\'s better vocals in awhile, this sounds like the theme to a Mexican shootout. The album stumbles greatly on St. Andrew which feels more like an experiment than a song. It follows the weirdly-likable bagpipe-driven Prickly Thorn but Sweetly Thorn but St. Andrew is just ugh. Things perk up with another best song contender in Little Cream Soda which has a rocking main riff and a Spaghetti Western-tinged verse riff. Rag and Bone is also a great blues number and it just sounds so...fun. The rest of the album is fine but they might not have the immediacy of some songs but at least it ends on the country-esque Effect and Cause.Like a lot of White Stripes songs, some of them are just so obviously good they kind of overshadow the rest, similar to how Hardest Button to Button and Seven Nation Army became immediate standouts. Icky Thump has similar problems in that a song like Bone Broke which is not bad or something like Catch Hell Blues and that these songs are fine to listen but don\\'t really have staying power. Meg\\'s minimilast drumming is still there and while he\\'s great at creating gotta-learn-it guitar riffs, his solos seem sometimes like random notes than creating any sense of melody or structure. Put it this way: if you like White Stripes before, you\\'ll still like them. If not, you just have to learn to love their weirdness.Most rock records lately have either been same ol\\' same ol\\' (Linkin Park), directionless (Queens of the Stone Age...I\\'m gonna get it for that one) or good-but-overproduced (Maroon 5). With its lo-fi production, odd lyrics and quirky music, it\\'s still one of the better rock releases so far.', 'overall': 5.0, 'summary': '4.5; one of the best rock releases this year', 'unixReviewTime': 1182297600, 'reviewTime': '06 20, 2007'}])]\n"
