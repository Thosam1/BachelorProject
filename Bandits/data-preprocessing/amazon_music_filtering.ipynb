But people with open minds could find there\\'s some beautiful melodies and harmonies as well as lively, upbeat tunes that are a joy to put on. I find the Memory of Trees to be one of her most consistent albums; plus it helps it has probably one of my top 5 favorite songs ever.The Memory of Trees: Like all of her records (except the recent Amarantine), the albums open with a wordless instrumental and this album\\'s title track is probably my favorite with gentle piano arpeggios and a beautiful vocal track. I always like the sparse use of percussion. 9/10Anywhere Is: The lively single; it\\'s actually a good sing-along with staccato beats and a great chorus. It\\'s also a perfect length since it\\'s under 3 minutes so whereas some pop songs drag after awhile, this one hooks you in then lets you go, leaving you wanting more. 9/10Pax Deorum: Another album, another ominous Latin-sung piece. The music sounds like something you\\'d hear in enemy territories in video games while Enya gives a low-voice, almost monotone performance over the music. Slightly repetitive until a 2nd higher voice comes in but the piece hits its stride halfway with a gorgeous bridge. 8/10Athair Ar Nearmh: There\\'s some songs she does where it\\'s more about the song itself rather than a poppy, catchy quality a la Only Time and this song\\'s similar. Another ballad with some of her best singing, it\\'s a more low-key track but it\\'s also one of the album highlights. 8.5/10From Where I Am: Another instrumental; this one\\'s a more piano-based piece that would be a nice song to learn for all pianists out there since it\\'s not technically complex or fast but it\\'s pleasant to listen to. 7.5/10China Roses: There\\'s only a handful of songs I could have on repeat and never get sick of them and this is one of them. Everything from the vocals and background instrumentation, the lyrics and not to mention one of the most relaxing and almost tranquil ending codas I\\'ve ever heard, this is definately my favorite song on here, plus her whole career even. 15/10Hope Has a Place: For me, any song after China Roses will probably suffer a tad but this song doesn\\'t do much for me. Granted, her vocals are as great as always and the song has a nice, relaxing mood but either this kind of track is too familiar (a kind of Athair part 2 if you will) or it\\'s just not as memorable. 7/10Tea-House Moon: Very oriental in its instruments, it\\'s another wordless song although it\\'s more enjoyable than From Where I Am is, mainly because the melodies are more memorable and it\\'s a bit more song-oriented. It\\'s different but strangely likable. 8/10Once You Had Gold: We\\'re getting into the album\\'s final stretch and the problem is that with this one, it\\'s a more quieter affair as you can feel the album almost winding down. With Enya\\'s more higher vocals (for some reason, reminiscent of her Silent Night rendition), it\\'s another beautiful track but it\\'s also a bit...same-y? 8/10La Sonadora: Spanish lyrics for once, it\\'s another slower paced track complete with \"aahs\" for background vocals and synths but again, the album could\\'ve benefited from a more perkier track. I do like what it does at the halfway point and gives the track a little boost. 7.5/10On My Way Home: A church organ opens the track and with a more bouncy synth, you\\'d think it was a bit more upbeat. While it\\'s not as lively as her vocals on Anywhere Is, it does give the album a bit more memorable closer, especially when the chorus comes where the track gets more fuller in its arrangements. 9/10While A Day Without Rain or Watermark is usually marked as one of her best (probably because her big hits Only Time and Orinoco Flow were on them), I find the Memory of Trees a more likable album and despite a lack of more upbeat tracks, it\\'s still one of her finest outings.', 'overall': 4.0, 'summary': '4.5; music to dream to', 'unixReviewTime': 1200528000, 'reviewTime': '01 17, 2008'}]\n"

Clearly, it's a song about pain - about not being able to commit oneself to someone one wants to love.  (Or something like that).

And the album ends with another humorous little jig.  It shows that cynicism and humor are connected.  Her more optimistic albums are also more serious throughout.In the early days, Joni often hit very high notes in the midst of her songs.

But a couple of the songs are heart-stopping or contain heart-stopping moments.THE BLONDE IN THE BLEACHERS starts off as a mild, easygoing melody, but suddenly, at the end, it completely turns - Joni seems to turn to the audience, break out of the song, and suddenly sing some surprising lyrics RIGHT AT YOU.LET THE WIND CARRY ME is a heartfelt confession/ballad that you will want to play over and over and over.  It is beautiful to the core.The album as a whole is complicated - both lyrically and melodically.  Like a great novel, it needs to be opened slowly, appreciated in morsels and then gradually as a whole.Most die-hard Joni fans I know say that this isn\\'t their number one favorite album.

But people with open minds could find there\\'s some beautiful melodies and harmonies as well as lively, upbeat tunes that are a joy to put on. I find the Memory of Trees to be one of her most consistent albums; plus it helps it has probably one of my top 5 favorite songs ever.The Memory of Trees: Like all of her records (except the recent Amarantine), the albums open with a wordless instrumental and this album\\'s title track is probably my favorite with gentle piano arpeggios and a beautiful vocal track. I always like the sparse use of percussion. 9/10Anywhere Is: The lively single; it\\'s actually a good sing-along with staccato beats and a great chorus. It\\'s also a perfect length since it\\'s under 3 minutes so whereas some pop songs drag after awhile, this one hooks you in then lets you go, leaving you wanting more. 9/10Pax Deorum: Another album, another ominous Latin-sung piece. The music sounds like something you\\'d hear in enemy territories in video games while Enya gives a low-voice, almost monotone performance over the music. Slightly repetitive until a 2nd higher voice comes in but the piece hits its stride halfway with a gorgeous bridge. 8/10Athair Ar Nearmh: There\\'s some songs she does where it\\'s more about the song itself rather than a poppy, catchy quality a la Only Time and this song\\'s similar. Another ballad with some of her best singing, it\\'s a more low-key track but it\\'s also one of the album highlights. 8.5/10From Where I Am: Another instrumental; this one\\'s a more piano-based piece that would be a nice song to learn for all pianists out there since it\\'s not technically complex or fast but it\\'s pleasant to listen to. 7.5/10China Roses: There\\'s only a handful of songs I could have on repeat and never get sick of them and this is one of them. Everything from the vocals and background instrumentation, the lyrics and not to mention one of the most relaxing and almost tranquil ending codas I\\'ve ever heard, this is definately my favorite song on here, plus her whole career even. 15/10Hope Has a Place: For me, any song after China Roses will probably suffer a tad but this song doesn\\'t do much for me. Granted, her vocals are as great as always and the song has a nice, relaxing mood but either this kind of track is too familiar (a kind of Athair part 2 if you will) or it\\'s just not as memorable. 7/10Tea-House Moon: Very oriental in its instruments, it\\'s another wordless song although it\\'s more enjoyable than From Where I Am is, mainly because the melodies are more memorable and it\\'s a bit more song-oriented. It\\'s different but strangely likable. 8/10Once You Had Gold: We\\'re getting into the album\\'s final stretch and the problem is that with this one, it\\'s a more quieter affair as you can feel the album almost winding down. With Enya\\'s more higher vocals (for some reason, reminiscent of her Silent Night rendition), it\\'s another beautiful track but it\\'s also a bit...same-y? 8/10La Sonadora: Spanish lyrics for once, it\\'s another slower paced track complete with \"aahs\" for background vocals and synths but again, the album could\\'ve benefited from a more perkier track. I do like what it does at the halfway point and gives the track a little boost. 7.5/10On My Way Home: A church organ opens the track and with a more bouncy synth, you\\'d think it was a bit more upbeat. While it\\'s not as lively as her vocals on Anywhere Is, it does give the album a bit more memorable closer, especially when the chorus comes where the track gets more fuller in its arrangements. 9/10While A Day Without Rain or Watermark is usually marked as one of her best (probably because her big hits Only Time and Orinoco Flow were on them), I find the Memory of Trees a more likable album and despite a lack of more upbeat tracks, it\\'s still one of her finest outings.', 'overall': 4.0, 'summary': '4.5; music to dream to', 'unixReviewTime': 1200528000, 'reviewTime': '01 17, 2008'}, {'reviewerID': 'A1AISPOIIHTHXX', 'asin': 'B000003TAW', 'reviewerName': 'Cloud \"...\"', 'helpful': [0, 1], 'reviewText': 'Frontman Rivers Cuomo to a lot of people can be a bit of an oddball. He\\'s extremely shy, rarely saying a whole lot in interviews, has those trademark nerd-like glasses and doesn\\'t seem like a rock star. However, like Brian Wilson, underneath all that is someone is very capable of delivering an infectious pop song with heart-on-sleeve type lyrics.My Name is Jonas: It\\'s probably my 2nd favorite album opener besides Where the Streets Have No Name. A simple fingerpicked acoustic intro before the band comes crashing than back again and it keeps going. Lyrically, I have no idea. 10/10No One Else: Probably the most infectious song about a controlling boyfriend. My favorite parts oddly enough are just before the chorus where he either goes \"watch her, watch her watch her watch her!\" or \"it\\'s a hey hey hey hey!\", I don\\'t know, just can\\'t help singing along to that part. 9/10The World Has Turned and Left Me Here: A very sad lyrically song about love lost and wanting it back. Favorite part is definately the end where there\\'s 2 vocals going on at once until they merge going \"do you believe what I sing now?\". 8/10Buddy Holly: Probably Weezer\\'s signature song, it\\'s short, catchy and had a great video. It\\'s quite fun to play on guitar too and there\\'s gonna be some kind of vocal that you\\'ll like singing too. 9/10Undone(The Sweater Song): The other wellknown song but to be honest it\\'s not a favorite. It starts with what\\'s possibly the catchiest arpeggio Weezer has until a quiet verse and the chorus comes in. It\\'s not a fav cause of the \"freak out\" at the end where they kind of go nuts. 7.5/10Surf Wax America: It\\'s quite neat looking at this: a jangly guitar line worthy of the Byrds, punky verses and choruses and a bridge with vocal harmonies all fit perfectly together. Lyrically, it\\'s about alcoholism I hear. 8/10Say It Ain\\'t So: 3rd single and another great one, even if I can\\'t really listen to it anymore due to overplayedness. Chorus is definately a highlight, bringing out the air guitarist in you. 8/10In the Garage: To be honest, I kind of hate this song. It\\'s probably the only song of theirs that I actually skip. Lyrically it brings out the inner nerd in people with guys jamming with Kiss posters around and playing Dungeons and Dragons. 6/10Holiday: It\\'s a kind of interesting song. It\\'s certainly catchy with big riffs but it may not have that lasting appeal to some but to me it\\'s a nice listen. Quite interesting is its bridge where like Surf Wax America they introduce this section that oddly works out even with its quirkiness, here it sounds like blues-y bass meets a barbershop quartet.Only in Dreams: Ah, this song. Dreams of dancing with the girl of our dreams only to realize it\\'s only dreams. A lot of people said Weezer should write another type of these and they should. After about 4-5 minutes, there\\'s this long awesome crescendo buildup that goes into this big solo before coming back down. It\\'s long but oh so great. 10/10One misstep, a on-the-fence song on album with 8 others that are great listens.

Musically, this record is the band at some of their most aggressive and loudest which makes for some big rock moments but sometimes very little in terms of actual songs.Rich: An intro that sets the tone: high-fretted guitar notes, big drum part, Karen O\\'s shift from singing to throaty yells and loud distorted riffs. It\\'s certainly an interesting song and the more I listen, the more I like so good on them. 8/10Date With the Night: Very groove-based song and one of the more memorable ones. However I will say the \"choke, choke!\" chorus where it gets loud, very distorted and a lot more aggro doesn\\'t sit well with me. The song\\'s got a great energy but whenever that part hits, for some reason I don\\'t care for it. 7.5/10Man: Another energetic song and all and again like Date With the Night, it\\'s got cool riffs but the problem is that it\\'s ridiculously short at 1:50. Good length or underwritten? Hm. 7/10Tick: Another really short one (strangely at 1:50 as well) and it\\'s certainly raucous and it\\'s actually funny, if only for Karen\\'s increasingly frenzied singing the more the thing goes on. It leaves an impression but then it goes away just as fast. 7/10Black Tongue: Now this one I like since it\\'s got cool riffs and it\\'s actually quite singable and catchy as well and Karen certainly shows quite a lot of attitude on this, which is probably why I like it more. 8/10Pin: For some reason the intro reminds me of that AC/DC song but oh well. Strangely it seems like the more the record progresses the better it gets in terms of melodies. Still not up to the standards of songs later on the record but it works. 7.5/10Cold Light: Somewhat underdeveloped for me and one I barely return to all that much. Not that there\\'s anything wrong with it in terms of structure and whatnot but it just doesn\\'t grab me. 6/10No No No: A really out there song with lots of big fat guitar riffs and noisy parts though it\\'s somewhat lacking in singable melodies but then it all of a sudden quiets down for some space-y feedback, strange guitar noises and more jam-like approach. Might polarize some. 7.5/10Maps: Now we get into the good stuff, and by that I mean the tracks that are exceptionally great. We start off with Maps, arguably their \"signature tune\" with Karen O\\'s emotive delivery having all the power in her voice by not overdoing it, or as we can say, the Celine Dion approach. Definitely worth a listen if you haven\\'t already. 9/10Y Control: Cool guitar intro at the start and all the big riffs really help the song become a really entertaining track and seems like they saved some of their better for last. And it\\'s actually a decent length too so yay. 9/10Modern Romance: A somewhat depressing song with a very bassy but melancholy guitar riff and Karen\\'s vocals at some of their more relaxed on the record. It\\'s something they\\'d explore a bit more with later records, mainly It\\'s Blitz so it\\'s great to see them not just do aggressive numbers the whole time. Funny thing is that it\\'s only 3 minutes and some long than there\\'s a secret track at the end so it\\'s shorter than it appears. 9/10From a song-by-song standpoint, Fever to Tell isn\\'t a very strong record until the home stretch but if you just leave it on and try not to look at certain songs individually it works quite well but the band will improve on each listen so this makes this a record that\\'s worth checking out though not one of their more consistent ones.', 'overall': 4.0, 'summary': 'This is the \"aggressive\" record of the band', 'unixReviewTime': 1241827200, 'reviewTime': '05 9, 2009'}, {'reviewerID': 'A1AISPOIIHTHXX', 'asin': 'B0002MSCBK', 'reviewerName': 'Cloud \"...\"', 'helpful': [10, 11], 'reviewText': 'Many groups in Canada simply do not get the recognition they should. For every talented bands that make it south of the border like Rush or Guess Who, there\\'s untalented ones like Avril Lavigne or Sum 41. Tegan and Sara are a pretty well-known group in Canada and have very little recognition in the States, which is too bad. They\\'ve released 3 records so far that have been excellent and they\\'re still not well-known. Oh well, guess we can rub it in some american\\'s face that they have to settle with Good Charlotte while we have Tegan and Sara and many others.You Wouldn\\'t Like Me(Tegan): Like Lennon and McCartney, each girl sings the song they\\'ve written instead of having a chief songwriter. This is a Tegan song and probably her best on here. A driving rhythm and an incredibly catchy melody make it a great opener. 10/10Take Me Anywhere(Tegan): A nice upbeat song, catchy chorus, and some nice background vocals. There\\'s a 2nd guitar near the end but I can barely hear it but that\\'s ok. 9/10I Bet It Stung(Sara): Definately Sara\\'s best on here. An incredibly driving rhythm makes it an almost epic-like quality for a 3 minute song. One complaint is her lead vocal sounds strange like when you talk into a fan but that\\'s a minor complaint for what would be a great single if they made it one. 10/10I Know I Know I Know(Tegan): It\\'s a lot of people\\'s favorite but maybe after the last song, it doesn\\'t hit much but it\\'s still good. I like the 2nd guitar during the pre-chorus and the end though, very effective. 8/10Where Does the Good Go(Tegan): The bassline sounds funny but it\\'s another good song where both girls sing parts together rather than separately or one\\'s mixed a bit low in the background. Love the chorus. 8/10Downtown(Sara): Finally we get to a Sara song and again it\\'s a good one. Very sad-sounding chord progression with a quite catchy chorus. And is it me, or does the song seem to be about oral sex? Just wondering. 9/10I Won\\'t Be Left(Tegan): Back to Tegan and opens with an almost punk-like guitar opening before the acoustic comes in. The background vocals are quite effective too. 8/10Walking With a Ghost(Sara): The first single and the guitar melody is so catchy you probably can\\'t help but pick up one and play along if you have one. It even has synth from Matt Sharp(ex-Weezer bassist). It\\'s a bit repetitive but it sounds better like that to me. 8/10So Jealous(Sara): Starts off with some interesting synth before the acoustic comes in and then explodes into the chorus when everyone comes in. 9/10Speak Slow(Tegan): The second single and a very upbeat rock song.  Great rhythm and a catchy chorus with it\\'s \"ah-ahh!\" part at the end. Probably my favorite bridge on the record. 9/10Wake Up Exhausted(Tegan): If it seems the songs are more lopsided to Tegan, they are, she has 8, Sara has 6. Oh well. Another standout with a weird fuzzy guitar after the verses. The \"are you alright?\" line for some reason I just like listening to. 9/10We Didn\\'t Do It(Sara): The opening guitar line almost reminds me of Walking With a Ghost but must be me. While the verses seem kind of poppy, the chorus is probably my favorite. The synthline combined with the rest of the instruments makes for a great chorus. If only the verses didn\\'t seem lopsided. 8/10Fix You Up(Tegan): The last Tegan song and it\\'s pretty good with my favorite part being the chorus where both girls sing then later when it\\'s repeated but it\\'s full band. Probably my second favorite Tegan song on here after You Wouldn\\'t Like Me. 9/10I Can\\'t Take It(Sara): The last Sara and album closer and to be honest, it\\'s probably my least favorite although it\\'s nicely sung. They should\\'ve switched this with Fix You Up and it would\\'ve been a better closer.Tegan and Sara are in that group \"talented unknowns\": they have the capability to be bigger than they are but for some reason people focus elsewhere(and I\\'m sure you know plenty of examples of this).

Sometimes people will say the single is the worst song on the album while in terrible records it\\'s actually the best and end up fooling buyers thinking the record was awesome. Not so with Get Behind Me Satan, the 5th album from the White Stripes led by duo Jack and Meg White. Now this is not a terrible record by any means, I mean it sure beats anything those pop punk dudes churn out but this isn\\'t a record with huge commercial appeal like Elephant. Probably even less so.The album starts out promisingly enough with \"Blue Orchid\" with Jack\\'s octave-affected guitar doing a catchy riff and singing something about orchids and how old someone is. I don\\'t know but it\\'s a great opening track. Next is the totally weird the Nurse which is led by a dulcimer and it\\'s just an odd track, not necessarily bad just...odd. We do have other songs like My Doorbell or the Denial Twist which are big piano-based numbers and while catchy, you kind of miss the guitars for some reason.The rest are separated into 2 types of songs. First half is the acoustic/piano stuff like Forever For Her (Is Over For Me) and White Moon with the former being one of his better ballads while the latter has a nice piano part yet it suffers from not really having a sense of melody to latch onto outside of the piano. Take, Take, Take which is a more upbeat acoustic song is alright but the chorus is just irritating. Afterwards we get what\\'s probably this album\\'s We\\'re Going to be Friends with a weirdly upbeat As Ugly as I Am which is actually quite fun to play as well as listen to.The other type is the big blues rock numbers akin to Ball and Biscuit from Elephant. Problem is outside of the main riff, Instinct Blues just feels way too long and is kind of uninteresting to listen. Red Rain is way better which shifts from soft slide guitar to big loud slide chords a la Seven Nation Army. The album ends with the soft piano I Get Lonely (But I Ain\\'t That Lonely Yet). It seems like an appropriate closer given the material on here and it\\'s a nice song to listen to but you probably won\\'t have it on repeat much.You got to give them credit for at least trying to shake things up a bit.

From the musicianship to the songwriting to the vocals, they're just plain bad and why they're still around is anyone's guess. The third is where everyone wants to be: the greats that can produce stellar records either as soon as they start or they eventually will. The second is where Silversun Pickups are and where a lot of bands tend to start: many aspects are strong but they have a tendency to do things that prevents them from being a completely solid band. Carnavas has songs that lack something that makes it a completely good song but the basic core of it is enough to warrant a listen.Melatonin: A good choice for an opener as it introduces the sound early on which is very buzzy. Guitarist/vocalist Brian Aubert shares vocals with bassist Nikki Mossinger and it makes for an intriguing opener. Only thing knocking it down a bit is that the vocals are hard to understand. 8/10Well Thought Out Twinkles: A catchy riff starts off the song but weirdly there's something slightly off, like it's missing a memorable vocal melody or catchy chorus but as it is, it's just a good rock song without a lot to latch onto, other than the riffs. 7.5/10Checkered Floor: Ah, now we're getting somewhere. Starts off as a slightly mid-tempo rock song with a catchy guitar lead line before it goes into a memorable chorus. It's definately to me one of the highlights on the whole album. 9/10Little Lover's So Polite: The other album highlight. A simplistic-yet-effective guitar line starts it off before we get a super fuzzy song about who knows what. Mossinger adds some dynamics to the song by lending her voice but the shift is slightly too abrupt for me. Vocals are fine but musically it doesn't quite gel. 8/10Future Foe Scenarios: Despite the fact it drags a bit, this is definately one of the better songs on here from Aubert's raw vocals to the super catchy fuzzy (be prepared to have a lot of fuzzyness on the album) guitar riff, it's evidence that this isn't a band with throwaway songs. 8.5/10Waste it On: Starts off as being a bass-driven atmospheric number before it picks up the pace and gets more energetic. However it takes a little while to get going but once it does, it's quite good. 7.5/10Lazy Eye: Why this was a single, I don't know. Now the guitar riffs are super catchy and at one point the song kind of explodes and gets more explosive but there's barely any catchy melodies/choruses and the song drags on way too much and you wonder why the 4 minute radio edit wasn't used since it's much better. 7.5/10Rusted Wheel: It starts off promising like most of the songs on the album, they're either slightly underdeveloped or they drag a bit. Melodies are there but for some reason, something seems lacking to me with the whole song like it didn't click despite repeated listens. 7/10Dream at Tempo 119: Another album highlight. I love the verse riff, the lead guitar line under the chorus and the chorus itself, this is how many of the songs on the album should've been: catchy and yet it still rocks. I don't need pop melodies everytime but I at least need something that makes the song stand out and luckily many things stand out with this song. 9/10Three Seed: A more low-key song with some nice ambience created and the whole thing has a very nice vibe to it all. It probably won't be many people's favorite but when you listen to it, you think that it's pretty good. 7.5/10Common Reactor: Another buzzy song that again has some compelling elements to it such as its chorus and would've been great if the band would just trim out the fat. What would've been a great 4 minute closer becomes a slightly meandering 6 minute one with long periods of noise at the end. But I still find it a highlight so it's not like most of the other songs. 8.5/10If the band can hook up with the right producer and develop the songs more, this could definately be a great band. But at this point, it's a promising debut and one that should have even better results on 2nd album. Oh by the way, the whole Smashing Pumpkins thing? I never remotely heard any similarities until I looked at other reviews. They might have a girl bassist and a vocalist with somewhat nasally androgynous vocals (strangly Aubert's a more tolerable singer) but don't be mistaken this is just a copycat band.\", 'overall': 4.0, 'summary': \"Like many debuts, it's compelling and promising\", 'unixReviewTime': 1176595200, 'reviewTime': '04 15, 2007'}, {'reviewerID': 'A1AISPOIIHTHXX', 'asin': 'B000NVIXFK', 'reviewerName': 'Cloud \"...\"', 'helpful': [8, 11], 'reviewText': 'Strange as it seems, the last \"proper\" Rush record arguably was 1997\\'s Test for Echo.

There was bright spots and feelings of classic Rush but it was marred by fuzzy guitars and just an overwhelming sense of dirtyness throughout and a lack of trademark Rush interplay with a bigger emphasis on loud, distorted guitars instead of mixing it up (such as Limelight or the all-clean Time Stand Still). Snakes & Arrows though is a return to a kind of sound that we all miss and while there\\'s not really any pop smash a la Tom Sawyer, it\\'s still an enjoyable record.Far Cry: First single and another top notch opener since they rarely disappoint starting their records. Big riffs and chords, this whole record feels like Rush circa Counterparts and this would\\'ve fit right along there. Weird solo though. 8.5/10Armor and Sword: Seems like an epic in the vein of Natural Science or Jacob\\'s Ladder. Great intro with a neat riff involving chords, harmonics and arpeggios.

Originally I didn\\'t like it (chorus, mainly) but it grew on me. 8.5/10The Larger Bowl: It\\'s quite an accessible track and radio could potentially embrace it if it\\'s a single with an radio friendly hook but strangely, I wasn\\'t a big fan of it. Maybe it just needs to grow on me more. 7.5/10Spindrift: Eerie arpeggios start the track before delving into an evil, onimous riff and the whole thing has a very compelling feeling to it. Reminds me of Witch Hunt or Double Agent in its tone. A very grandiose rocker. 8.5/10The Main Monkey Business: Possibly to make up for the lack of an instrumental on Vapor Trails, this is the first of 3. While it won\\'t send guitarists to the woodshop like YYZ did, this is probably their best instrumental in years. Many changes and great interplay including some synth backing, this is an album highlight. 9.5/10The Way the Wind Blows: Even though it\\'s a bit more rockier and blues-y, it always reminds me of a more faster Nobody\\'s Hero or Resist. It\\'s also one of the album\\'s greater songs with a fast tempo and an anthemic chorus. If you want to test the waters, this is a good track to listen to first. 9/10Hope: Now this will either scare away or get guitarists ramped up. A Middle-Eastern flavored instrumental acoustic piece courtesy of \"Lerxst Lifeson\", it\\'s nice to listen to but other than guitarists, most will probably skip it. 8/10Faithless: The record as a whole has the theme of faith in things and what can change it and this song is like the basic idea of that. Musically though, a mid-tempo number with plenty of progness going on,  it\\'s alright but again, it didn\\'t catch me on first listen and after a few, it still hasn\\'t. 7.5/10Bravest Face: I\\'m not a big fan of the verses but everything else works perfectly. Many musical changes from acoustics to patented Lifeson arpeggios and a great chorus, this is one of those songs on the record where you\\'ll keep coming back to it as you keep listening. 9/10Good News First: Musically, it\\'s actually quite an interesting listen. It\\'s just the rest of it as a song works at times but not consistently. It seems to be a song that almost lacks a strong enough hook which many Rush songs usually have. 7/10Malignant Narcissism: The title (which has shades of \"an exercise in self-indulgence\" that La Villa Strangiato had, is taken from Team America: World Police and even appears in the song itself. The last of the instrumentals and is probably the more straightforward of them, like Where\\'s My Thing. Geddy Lee is all over the place with his bass here. 9/10We Hold On: Like Everyday Glory, it ends the record on a kind of uplifting note. It\\'s not quite fullblown optimism, just a more hopeful one. It\\'s also one of the more likable songs on the record and in a warped world, could even be a song radio could embrace but since they always look for Tom Sawyer part II, it wouldn\\'t do anything which is too bad. 9/10I think people by now know they\\'re not going to do another Moving Pictures or Permanent Waves. Whereas those albums had more a feeling of songs intended to be chockful of hooks, these are more slow burner songs that eventually get into your head. A good handful from here will get into your head and it\\'s nice to see the production lend itself to the songs.', 'overall': 5.0, 'summary': 'A welcome addition to an impressive catalog', 'unixReviewTime': 1178323200, 'reviewTime': '05 5, 2007'}, {'reviewerID': 'A1AISPOIIHTHXX', 'asin': 'B000OYC3J8', 'reviewerName': 'Cloud \"...\"', 'helpful': [0, 1], 'reviewText': 'The White Stripes originally were a band that I kind of liked but not really. I always saw them as the better band in that \"The\" garage rock scene from the Vines to the Hives but at times many of the songs on album releases were more about them rocking out but not really delivering anything in terms of melody. Sure it\\'s fun to just play but it would be nice if we caught that energy too. After the difficult-to-get-into album Get Behind Me Satan, the White Stripes make a return with a record that\\'s as accessible as anything they\\'ve done.The album starts out with Icky Thump which follows the tradition that Seven Nation Army and Blue Orchid set which is led by a catchy rock riff, particularly the \"chorus\". Jack sings lyrics concerning an encounter with a Mexican prostitute and while I\\'m not a fan of the solo at the end, it\\'s still a great opener. The next song is another enjoyable one with You Don\\'t Know What Love is. Big loud blues-y rocker, it\\'s just a fun song to listen and it even has a chorus you can sing along to. What was probably meant to be the Ball and Biscuit of the album (a more blues-improv number where Jack can let his guitar flag fly), 300 M.P.H Torrential Outpour Blues just kind of meanders.A strange contender for the best song on the album, Conquest has Mexican horns, charging guitars and probably Jack\\'s better vocals in awhile, this sounds like the theme to a Mexican shootout. The album stumbles greatly on St. Andrew which feels more like an experiment than a song. It follows the weirdly-likable bagpipe-driven Prickly Thorn but Sweetly Thorn but St. Andrew is just ugh. Things perk up with another best song contender in Little Cream Soda which has a rocking main riff and a Spaghetti Western-tinged verse riff. Rag and Bone is also a great blues number and it just sounds so...fun. The rest of the album is fine but they might not have the immediacy of some songs but at least it ends on the country-esque Effect and Cause.Like a lot of White Stripes songs, some of them are just so obviously good they kind of overshadow the rest, similar to how Hardest Button to Button and Seven Nation Army became immediate standouts. Icky Thump has similar problems in that a song like Bone Broke which is not bad or something like Catch Hell Blues and that these songs are fine to listen but don\\'t really have staying power. Meg\\'s minimilast drumming is still there and while he\\'s great at creating gotta-learn-it guitar riffs, his solos seem sometimes like random notes than creating any sense of melody or structure. Put it this way: if you like White Stripes before, you\\'ll still like them. If not, you just have to learn to love their weirdness.Most rock records lately have either been same ol\\' same ol\\' (Linkin Park), directionless (Queens of the Stone Age...I\\'m gonna get it for that one) or good-but-overproduced (Maroon 5). With its lo-fi production, odd lyrics and quirky music, it\\'s still one of the better rock releases so far.', 'overall': 5.0, 'summary': '4.5; one of the best rock releases this year', 'unixReviewTime': 1182297600, 'reviewTime': '06 20, 2007'}])]\n"

Maybe I was expecting Shepherd's Moon Part II and saw Memory Of Trees as Shepherd's Eclipse.  The songs didn't leap out to me?  Well, listening to it for this review, it finally did, and I've embraced it like I have her other albums.  The four years inbetween albums was worth it.Of the opening instrumental title tracks, &quot;The Memory Of Trees&quot; is the most potent, sporting the usual instrumentals, pianos, haunting wall-of-sound choir-like vocals, pounding drums recalling &quot;The Longships&quot; from Watermark.The brisk &quot;Anywhere Is&quot;, whose dominant tempo reminds me of a horse having a gentle canter down a park, is backed by strings and backing vocals.  There's an interesting motif in the first line of her reaching a horizon but finding another, where something that looks like an end is actually a new beginning.  Bit like life, isn't it?&quot;Pax Deorum&quot; is a Latin track begins with a cold dark wind, which sets the grim bass pulsing keyboard permeating throughout the song, as well as an ominous sound that sounds a bit like a foghorn, though not as loud or brash.  This part sounds a bit like an incantation.  Her voice alternates between a soft but lower register and her full vocals.The piano (and later some other instrument) ballad &quot;Athair Ar Neamh&quot; is a sad but beautiful sung tune, full of yearning.  Makes me want to learn Gaelic.  My favourite song here, and Enya sounds her best singing like this.The wistful, reflective piano only instrumental &quot;From Where I Am&quot; is a variation of &quot;Miss Clare Remembers&quot; from Watermark, with some shades of &quot;Epona&quot; from the Enya album.&quot;China Roses&quot; is one of her visual and visionary poetic songs and it's an enchanting delight to hear.  I see melodic strains of what would later become &quot;Only Time.&quot;  That wall of sound really enhances her vocals, and the following lyrics really create the image of a dreamland:  &quot;A new moon leads me to/woods of dreams and I follow/a new world waits for me/my dream, my way&quot; and &quot;Rain and river, a world of wonder/may be paradise to me&quot;.  Gosh, how I love this woman!OK, all you romantics.  &quot;Hope Has A Place&quot; is the song for you.  Enya's vocal echoes hauntingly here and that dreamy wall of sound is in full bloom.  And how's this for some sagely advice:  &quot;Look to love/you may dream/and if it should leave/then give it wings/But if such a love is meant to be/Hope is home, and the heart is free.&quot;  I can't decide whether I like this better than &quot;Athair Ar Neamh.&quot;The third instrumental, &quot;Tea-House Moon&quot;, has some Oriental strains, with some otherworldly synths and conjures the image of one looking up at the stars.  As for the title, a nod to Teahouse Of The August Moon, set in post-WW2 Japan and starring Machiko Kyo?&quot;Once You Had Gold&quot; is a proverbial seasons come, seasons go type, and has a mystical sense of why things go wrong:  &quot;No-one can promise a dream for you/Time gave both darkness and dreams to you.&quot; and &quot;What is the dark, shadows around you/why not take heart in the new day?&quot;&quot;La Sonadora&quot; is her first Spanish song and it's more an interlude.  The backing wall of music rise to a crescendo in the song's midsection.A reminiscing night traveller's thoughts comprise &quot;On My Way Home&quot;, where &quot;I remember all the best days/I'm on my way home/I can remember every new day&quot; is surrounded by the dreamy wall of sound.Compared to her first three albums, Enya's voice is more mesmerizingly beautiful than I've ever heard.  She seems to be a one-woman band here, as it's &quot;all instruments and vocals by Enya&quot; per the credits.

One is the catchy US #1 \"Caribbean Queen (No More Love On The Run)\", part of which borrows the syncopated rhythm from Michael Jackson\\'s \"Billie Jean.\"  The sound effects includes eerie laughter similar to Vincent Price in \"Thriller\" and some suggestive sounds, not surprising in this song about a Caribbean seductress with painted-on jeans.  The highlight is V. Jeffrey Smith\\'s brief sax solo.  The title track is a schmaltzy ballad on how suddenly one wakes up and finds oneself in love.  \"Loverboy\", co-written by producer Keith Diamond and Mutt Lange, has a wandering pulsing synth beat throughout and a kind of hard-driving chorus, while \"Mystery Lady\" is a mid-paced dance number.\"When The Going Gets Tough (The Tough Get Going)\" from Jewel of the Nile, topped the UK charts, and nearly did so in the US, and is a feel-good dance anthem with funky synths.  The male backups have a masculine growl on the chorus, while the female singers soften things up some of the refrains.  This hit was co-written by and executive produced by Mutt Lange.  This was also included in Love Zone, whose title track is a leisurely mid-paced ballad punctuated by lush synths and a funky bass.However, the best song from that album and my personal Ocean song ever is the tear-jerker #1 \"There\\'ll Be Sad Songs (To Make You Cry).\"  The strings, quiet Clive Davis-like synths, and Ocean\\'s falsetto all combine to make this a winner.  In saying how love songs touch the very heart of someone, Ocean reprises what Elton John sang two years earlier, that \"sad songs say so much.\"Ocean\\'s last big hit was \"Get Outta My Dreams, Get Into My Car\", another catchy dance anthem and another soundtrack song, from the Corey Feldman vehicle (no pun intended) Licence To Drive.  Some eye-rolling suggestive car-talk involves, \"touch my bumper\" and \"let me take your wheel\" but this was big enough to reach #1.  Also from Tear Down These Walls is \"The Colour of Love,\" another attempt at a hit ballad, which doesn\\'t have the same effect as \"Suddenly\" or \"There\\'ll Be Sad Songs.\"Of the two new songs, \"Licence To Chill\" fits more in the dance pop category, and is a close cousin to \"Get Out Of My Dreams.\"  Mutt Lange\\'s production touches are evident here, particularly in the anthemic refrain:  \"Yeah Billy, yo Billy, way to go Billy.\"  Ditto for the funky masculine bed-hopping of \"I Sleep So Much Better In Someone Else\\'s  Bed.\"  I can\\'t hardly imagine someone like Ocean singing something so sexist, but that aspect of the song is given by the Fresh Prince portraying the smooth-talking cad and Mimi the put upon woman in a typical lover\\'s quarrel.As this compilation is released by Jive Records, his late 70\\'s hits, such as \"Love Really Hurts Without You\" and \"Red Light Spells Danger,\" released on GTO Records, aren\\'t included-that is on the Ultimate Collection, released last year.

She had retained the same production team-if it ain\\'t broke...  But the followup benefits from having better arrangements and instrumentations, while embodying a musical style now sadly long gone.Instead of merely writing this song, Diane Warren puts on her producer\\'s hat with Guy Roche.  \"If I Could Turn Back Time,\" whose strident rhythms with the same synth and fiery guitar from her previous album, made it to #3 on the charts and a week atop the Adult Contemporary charts.  With a host of backing vocalists, including Desmond Child, Robin Beck, and Maria Vidal, plus guitar from Steve Lukather, who\\'d contributed on \"I Found Someone,\" this couldn\\'t fail and it didn\\'t.  However, with the video aboard a US aircraft carrier with an ever-so revealing outfit, the song might as well have been called \"If I Could Show My Behind.\"  What\\'s also revealing and tried and true are some things I have experienced:  \"Pride\\'s like a knife it can cut deep inside/words are like weapons they wound sometimes.\"  Words have hurt me too much at times, so I know.The second single, the power ballad written by Diane Warren and Desmond Child, \"Just Like Jesse James,\" challenging a ladykiller and trying to drop him off the swaggering macho cloud he\\'s floating on, indeed has lyrics with the aura of a Western showdown.  This #8 hit also features backing vocals by Child, Warren, and Brenda Russell (\"Get Here,\" \"Piano In The Dark\").  Another winning song.Bolton and Warren co-write, with the former producing and arranging \"You Wouldn\\'t Know Love,\" which is straight 80\\'s synth-laced music complete with its host of backing vocals.  His production and songwriting on \"Still In Love With You\" and \"Starting Over,\" the latter co-written with Journey\\'s Jonathan Cain embodies the same style.Her cover of Desmond Child\\'s reflective \"Love On A Rooftop,\" produced by Asher, also on percussion, was not the first time I\\'d heard it, as Ronnie Spector had done her version two years earlier on Unfinished Business, which makes at least three versions, including Child\\'s own, which came out in 1991.  This has more of a crunch to it, airy keyboard-wise and guitar-wise, the latter courtesy of the Heartbreakers\\' Waddy Wachtel.  A strong single-worthy rendition, though the more low-key version by Spector fits me more.  Asher also produced the duet between her and Peter Cetera, \"After All,\" which was from the movie Chances Are.  A #6 hit, this spent 4 weeks atop the AC charts, and is a classic 80\\'s type pop ballad, and something Chicago probably\\'d have no problem doing around their 17 or 18 albums.  Wachtel also does guitar here as well.  Another favourite here.The other Child-produced songs, \"Emotional Fire\" has the raging power to be on a Bon Jovi album, with harmonic chorus as strong as on BJ\\'s \"Living On A Prayer.\"  Speaking of which, Jon Bon Jovi and Richie Sambora help co-write \"Does Anybody Really Fall In Love Anymore.\"  A rhetoric question posed here is:  \"There\\'s a lonely world around me/I get sucked in by the tide/I said, hey, love ain\\'t no crime/so why is everybody so afraid to cross that line.\"  I found out the hard way.  This is the song Kane Roberts later did in 1991.A successor to Cher\\'s 87 album, this is evidence enough that Cher had that second wind going for her.  I mean, three Top Ten singles, one of them Top 5, and the #20 title track, not bad.

The basso male backing vocalist provide a good balance with Olivia's winsome pop vocals.As for the rest, it's the requisite collection of hits, of which there are plenty, as well as four new songs.  The first one was penned and co-produced by Diane Warren, showing she has something in her magic pen for O N-J.  &quot;Deeper Than A River&quot; belongs squarely in the 80's tradition of dreamy pop ballads, complete with synthesizers and strings.&quot;Not Gonna Be The One&quot; could easily belong on one her Totally Hot album, as there are similarities to this and &quot;A Little More Love.&quot;  Produced by her longtime producer John Farrar.Her cover of Brenda Lee's #1 hit, &quot;I Want To Be Wanted,&quot;--who doesn't want to be?--is my favourite of the four new songs here, showing her ability to put forth great ballads haven't diminished with her Grammy winner.  And with Peter Asher (Peter of Peter and Gordon) as producer, how can she go wrong?&quot;I Need Love&quot; is 80's soul/pop and synth fills set to a funky bass backbeat, with some monologue thrown in.  In an ironic reference to an earlier hit, she sings that she holding out for something more than physical.  Clearly it's something more permanent:  &quot;I'm not looking for a bandaid on loneliness.&quot;  Aren't we all?  And this is the most un-Moroder sounding Giorgio Moroder production I've heard.In a twist of fate, many of her best-known songs turned out to be soundtrack hits.  And because of that, N-J gets tarred with the epithet 70's cheese when many are asked to classify her.  Two of them were from Grease, both duets with John Travolta.  The bouncy &quot;You're The One That I Want,&quot; penultimate number in the movie with the catchy bass setting the rhythm of the song, and a big hit in the US, spent nine weeks at the top in England.  &quot;Summer Nights,&quot; a song placed clearly in the musical genre, also went to #1 in the UK.  The other #1, &quot;Xanadu,&quot; is not on there, but &quot;Magic&quot; also from that movie, is.Of the other movie tracks, the fast-paced pop of &quot;Twist Of Fate,&quot; from Two Of A Kind, her second teaming up with Travolta, with its racing electropop bass synth and fuzzy guitar, definitely shows her staying power in 1983, and as far as this collection went, as material from Soul Kiss and The Rumour are excluded.  The other, from Grease, is her soaring strings and steel guitar ballad, &quot;Hopelessly Devoted To You,&quot; showing a mixture of pop and country instruments.In the US, one of her last gasps at greatness was the smart and punchy title track to her &quot;Physical&quot; album, but singles like thatand lines like &quot;let's get physical/let me hear your body talk&quot; showed her embracing the naughty Sandy side of her.  Small wonder the album cover, showing her flushed from an exercise workout, was mistaken for...well, physical things.From Don't Stop Believin' (1976) comes the melting strings ballad &quot;Sam.&quot;  And from the previous year, &quot;Have You Never Been Mellow?&quot; taken from the album of the same name, was a leisure mid-paced number with strings, and showed Olivia adding her two cents to the feminist bandwagon: &quot;someone else be strong&quot; or &quot;comfort from inside,&quot; reflecting the inner spotlight people began turning on in the 70's.  Another song from that album is the country tune &quot;Please Mr. Please,&quot; a pleading request to someone not to play a certain song for fear of being reminded of a past love.Despite the subtitle 1971-1992, the earliest songs here date from 1974's If You Love Me, Let Me Know.

Upon hearing it, I discovered she\\'d covered a Laura Branigan song I\\'d so adored on her Hold Me album.  The song was of course \"I Found Someone,\" which consisted of Michael Bolton\\'s synth-oriented production, the same way he\\'d do Jennifer Rush on Passion.  Cher\\'s eponymous 1987 album was a vehicle to her second comeback following a string of movie successes, and is a snapshot of the slick synth/pop music of the 80\\'s, when hard rock and pop consisted of layered synths and power ballads, the genre Bon Jovi succumbed to in Slippery When Wet.As a diehard Branigan fan, I prefer the original, but there is a place for this remake, given the wall of synths production, and Toto\\'s Steve Lukather giving help on guitar and on a solo.  Cher\\'s version scratched the Top Ten compared to Branigan\\'s #90.Jon Bon Jovi and his bandmates give Cher lots of help here, whether it be on instruments or backing vocals, or songwriting.  \"We All Sleep Alone,\" the #14 single, was co-written and featured backing vocals by Jon Bon Jovi, Richie Sambora, and rock producer Desmond Child.  Another backing vocalist here is legendary songwriter Holly Knight, late of Spider and Device.  There is that sage acceptance that sooner or later, we all sleep alone.  The same team contribute on a souped up version of \"Bang Bang,\" which she had done in the 60\\'s with Sonny.  There is an operatic quality to the backing vocals, which is then given a harder-edged sound thanks to Richie Sambora, and a wall of synth sound by Holly Knight and Chuck Kentis.  I heard this version before the original, and in a rare move, find this to be my version.Desmond Child wrote and sang backups on the ballad \"Main Man,\" something Cher has had difficulty hanging onto ironically enough.  No, really, this is actually a great power ballad.  He and Diane Warren also co-wrote \"Give Our Love A Fighting Chance\" and \"Perfection,\" the first a power song that could fit on a Bon Jovi album, Slippery When Wet-era of course.  On the second song, Bonnie Tyler and Darlene Love sing the first two lines and are the featured vocalists joining Cher.  The song\\'s theme of being at perfection at work AND at love reflects Cher\\'s choice in singing it, given her marital track record with Sonny and later Gregg Allman.\"Skin Deep,\" though an upbeat number, managed a #79 showing on the charts.  The Desmond Child-Michael Bolton written \"Working Girl\" is a commentary on the hard work and harassment office women get.  The last track the Bolton-produced and co-written \"Hard Enough Getting Over You\" lists the painful reasons why one is reluctant to allow someone back into their life, be it the hurt from lies and the fear of latent pain becoming manifest.  One of the better non-singles here.Cher\\'s comeback is also a testimony to the 80\\'s synth-oriented music produced by Desmond Child and Michael Bolton-okay, I\\'ll give Bolton credit for his songwriting and production, but not his singing!

If any album was cheated of the Grammy for Album of the Year, it was this one.Sixteen songs is a hefty load for this album.  Trouble is, all the songs are either infectious rock-pop and ballads, I want to review them all, but will content myself with the highlight of highlights.Shania lets herself go with the rock-oriented opening track, celebrating the freedom to enjoy herself in \"Man! I Feel Like A Woman.\"  Note that she says, woman as opposed to lady, and the lines \"I ain\\'t gonna act politically correct\" hints at the fun she wants.The pace picks up with \"I\\'m Holdin\\' On To Love (To Save My Life)\" made noticeable when Shania sings with only the fast-paced drums playing.\"Love Gets Me Everytime\" does have a trace of country with that fiddle and guitar and when she says \"I gol\\' darn gone and done it.\"  It\\'s basically on a woman who was enjoying her single life until she discovered that romantic side of her.\"Don\\'t Be Stupid\" is my favourite song here with that fiddle and that clapping drum that accompanies it after the chorus.  She exhorts her loved one not to start suspecting her when she does the slightest thing.  How bad is it?  \"You even get suspicious when I paint my nails/It\\'s definitely distracting/The way you dramatize every little small detail.\"The ballad duet with Bryan White, \"From This Moment On\" is a song on love and fidelity that is appropriate for playing at a wedding.  A song that could be a sequel to this is the other hit ballad, \"You\\'re Still The One\".  And speaking of ballads, I prefer \"You\\'ve Got A Way\" to the former.\"When\" is a reflective mid-paced song about wishful thinking laced with a touch of cynicism.  So when will the protagonist stop living in a dream or make up?  \"When money grows on trees/People live in peace/Everyone agrees/When happiness is free/Love can guarantee/You\\'ll come back to me--that\\'s when\"  In other words, never.  My second favourite song.The countrified Def Leppard tune that\\'s \"Honey I\\'m Home\" portrays one stressed out working woman who\\'s really had a bad day that rivals even PMS and feels much better once she comes home.  If the backing male vocals going \"Hey! Hey!\" reminds one of Def Leppard, remember, that\\'s Mutt Lange.\"That Don\\'t Impress Me Much\" puts down people who have the looks but not the touch.  Best disdainful line:  \"OK, so you\\'re think you\\'re Elvis or something.  Whatever.\"  And the rollicking \"Rock This Country\" could bring life to any dull party.The sobering \"Black Eyes, Blue Tears\" is about the need to get out of an abusive relationship and to \"find your self-esteem and be free to forever dream.\"  Key line:  \"I\\'d rather die standing than live on my knees begging please--no more.\"  The mid-paced \"I Won\\'t Leave You Lonely\" has a rhythm section recalling the Police\\'s \"Every Breath You Take.\"All the songs and backing vocals were done by Shania and husband the Mutt, who cut his teeth producing Def Leppard\\'s Pyromania and Hysteria and Bryan Adams\\' Waking Up The Neighbours.

The distance travelled between different media, from that wireless back in 1952 to the then-present day of 1979, can be heard in the distorted male vocals and the strings, which evoke a kind of nostalgia for the lost past.

Might as well go to the beginning.  1981 yielded the first album with the Go-Go\\'s, with Belinda Carlisle, Jane Wiedlin, Charlotte Caffey, Kathy Valentine, and Gina Schock.  Through three initial albums and the recent reunion album, they have spawned many female groups who have taken their cheery pop-evolved from punk style and zipped through the musical hyperspace byways with it.  Beauty And The Beat is the album that started it, a soundtrack of the valley.  It also legitimized power pop girl groups that continue today, albeit with a harder-edged punk sound.The two singles proved beyond anything what they were capable of.  I\\'m of course referring to \"Our Lips Are Sealed,\" that positively gushing number against what we would today call haters.  Lyrics include:  \"There\\'s a weapon /We must use/In our defense/Silence/When you look at them/Look right through them/That\\'s when they\\'ll disappear/That\\'s when you\\'ll be feared.\"  Something admirable to heeded, because if you rise to someone trying to get your goat, they win.  Take Carlisle and company\\'s advice, and you win!  Remember, \"Pay no mind to what they say.  It doesn\\'t matter anyway, hey hey hey.\"The equally danceable \"We Got The Beat\" is a song about people who...well, you figure it out.  High school students especially have the beat here, as they are leaving school to hang out late.  Remember:  \"Everybody get on your feet/We know you can dance to the beat/Jumpin\\' - get down/Round and round and round.\"A quick-paced energetic skiffle-like number, \"How Much More\" follows \"Our Lips Are Sealed.\" Equally upbeat is \"Tonite,\" which focuses on the night life in town.Quick cuts:  \"Fading Fast\" is a bit of melancholy, upbeat breakup tune.  \"Automatic,\" written by Jane Wiedlin, is the slow song here.  I hesitate to call it a ballad in the traditional sense, as it\\'s kind of minimalist with mechanical overtones.\"You Can\\'t Walk In Your Sleep (If You Can\\'t Sleep)\" has that same skiffle-like sound as \"How Much More,\" and is a song about insomnia.\"Skidmarks On My Heart\", which starts out with the same drumming rat-tat-tat as \"We Got The Beat,\" displays the classic conflict between boy and girl.  The boy\\'s too absorbed in his GTO, the girl simply wants more affection and attention, attention that he is giving to his car:  \"You sure know how to hurt a girl/Fewer hugs and no more kisses/Just water for your carburetor/And bearings for your pistons/Rev her engine for your pleasure/Caress and fondle her steering wheel/When you moan and hug her gear shift/Stop! Think how it makes me feel\".  Ouch!  This is also complete with a surf guitar solo by Charlotte Caffey.The album finishes with \"Can\\'t Stop The World\" written by bassist Kathy Valentine, which has an initial defeatist attitude of being unable to fight the licks of life.  However, after the chorus is repeated, Belinda then sings the hopeful coda thrice:  \"Don\\'t let it stop you.\"Quick note:  most of the songs were written by either Charlotte Caffey or Jane Wiedlin, sometimes both.  Belinda may have the voice, but those two have the pen.The Donnas, Halo Friendlies, and Eyeliners would not have gotten where they are now without the Go-Go\\'s, to whom they owe a massive debt.

Buying the full album later on, Sailing became and still is to date my favourite by Les Claypool and friends.  The songs pulse and pound a lot more due to Claypool\\'s uptempo bass and Tim Alexander\\'s drumming.  And Claypool\\'s quirky vocals give Primus an added recognizable uniqueness.The churning rowdy grind of bass and drums in the instrumental interlude of \"Jerry Was a Race Car Driver\" is what caught my ears to that song.  An uptempo tune of the title character, who never finished first or last, but later had an unfortunate ending at an early age.Equally rhythmic and upbeat is \"Tommy the Cat,\" with Tom Waits playing the title character.  The song recounts a tale of a hot feline looking for that he-cat of alleycats, namely the title cat.  Waits himself sounds like he could do guest stints in Primus with his raconteur personality.  This song was actually originally released live on their Suck On This album.The third was \"Those D-mned Blue Collar Tweakers,\" with a leisurely but playful rhythm beat, about how the title characters run the town, be it truckers, workers hammering in nails, or even someone hanging drywall who needs his fix to get the job done quick, but the town turns a blind eye.  A funny reference to Papa Bush is \"curious George\\'s drug patrol is out here hunting snipe.\"  At least I think it\\'s Bush 41.After the introductory ditty, Primus\\'s killer rhythm section introduces \"Here Come The Bastards\" with a marching tempo.  The concept of the title bastards introducing ideas-\"something about a hammerhead shark, nosehairs and flatus\" lends a bizarre Pythonseque turn to the song, but with Primus, well, what do you expect?  The line of \"anonymity is a virtue in this day and age\" is universal enough, but ten years after this album was released, \"flagrant misuse of Security\" seems relevant, especially with HL Security\\'s tramping on our freedoms.  The song is reprised in \"Los Bastardos\" with the \"here they come\" refrain chanted over and over.The brutality of the military mind, the \"game of warfare\" and the need to put recruits into lockstep is shown in the jamming \"Sgt. Baker,\" with bits of wry humor mixed with Baker\\'s character.  The chorus goes in a left-right left-right marching rhythm:  \"I will r-pe your personality/pummel you with my own philosophy/strip you of your self-integrity/to make you all a bit like me.\"  Uh, anyone STILL want to join the military after this?Three verses tell sobering tales of people living the \"American Life,\" of a Sicilian family who decides to go to Ellis Island after the father dies, Ong, a Laotian refugee earning minimum wage in LA, and perhaps the saddest, of Bob the unemployed veteran who sleeps in a cardboard box hunts for aluminum cans, yet somehow manages to maintain his dignity.You know how people go, \"That\\'s what they say\" or \"They tell me\"? Well, who\\'s \"they\"?  The pounding song \"Eleven\" is a paean for those who can\\'t seem to conform to society or accept \"this dim simplicity of law and order.\"  Nothing treasonous about not seeing rhyme or reason in those rules.The frantic tweeked out \"Is It Luck\" is a question asked in response to certain lines, be it something silly like \"cyanide works oh so fast\" to something serious like \"there was food in your mouth today.\"  A silly and great number.

The other is \"Jimmy Mack\" which has a snappy pop/soul sound complete with clapping.  Sheena Easton\\'s did a version with similar tempo in 1986.

She describes home as a liberating influence:  \"My life there has it\\'s own wings/To fly over the mountains/Though I\\'m standing still.\"  \"Faces In The Wind\" is lullaby-type country ballad.The electric piano and bass really forms the framework for the upbeat \"Isn\\'t It Always Love,\" which I can picture Carly Simon covering.  In the course of a reflective walk, Karla sagely says of the two faces of love:  \"Isn\\'t it always love that makes you hang your head/Isn\\'t it always love that makes you cry/And isn\\'t it always love that takes the tears away/And I wouldn\\'t have it any other way.\"The third song Ronstadt covered from here is the gentle acoustic ballad \"If He\\'s Ever Near\", which gets backing vocal support from Glenn Frey and J.D. Souther.  Yes, it is hard to find that someone who\\'s the right one, isn\\'t it?\"Flying High\" is a mid-paced country-ish song that again tells of the ups and downs of love, told to her by a gypsy fortune teller.  The story has a happy ending, so that\\'s good.Missing someone was never made so painful than in the acoustic ballad \"Falling Star,\" where she realizes \"that love can leave a scar.\"  She does have a good high note when she sings how she\\'s going down like the title object.  It\\'s so bad, that \"when the birds fly south for a while/Oh, I wish that I could go/Someone there might warm this cold heart.\"  One of the best songs here.The final ballad displays an analogy between a rose and love.  Like the \"Rose In The Garden\", \"It will bloom if you\\'re sure/That you pay close attention/but leave it room.\"Linda Ronstadt helps out with backing vocals here, as does Waddy Wachtel with his guitar.A wonderful debut, highlighted by Karla\\'s melodic vocals.

What this song did establish with that galloping, snarling guitar was that women could rock.  Although they did reach rock peaks with the Bebe Le Strange and Heart albums, this set the standard, something that would be duplicated in the song \"Back In Black II\" from Desire Walks On.The next three songs have a kind of nature theme sound to them.  Must be that album cover with the gypsy-like caravan.  The mellow \"Love Alive\" features some exotic instruments, such as a flute, tabla and an autoharp.  The tempo then picks up with drums and electric guitar, mirroring that \"sunbeam arch thrilled me to my weary heart/It was the prettiest thing I ever seen\" line sung a few verses earlier.  In some ways, this reminds me of a stripped down \"Magic Man.\"The brief instrumental \"Sylvan Song\" has Nancy Wilson and Roger Fisher on mandolins.  That and the moog bass by Howard Leese gives it an alternately folky and new age sound to it.This segues into \"Dream Of The Archer\", which gives an medieval lyrical image, with Wilson and Fisher still on mandolins.  The sylphs in the forest have clearly bewitched the archer here.\"Kick It Out\" is the other rocker about a wild child.  Her motto:  \"Kick out your motor and drive/while you\\'re still alive--kick it out.\"The next three songs make a sagging midsection that causes me to deduct a point.  The title track is a mid-paced number with a prominent bass.  Then comes Nancy\\'s solo vocal number, the ballad \"Treat Me Well\", which has a touch of blues, and is helped out by piano and drums accompaniment.  However, this isn\\'t one of their better songs.  The quasi-skiffle of \"Say Hello\" is lively with the mandolin riffs, with Ann\\'s echoing vocals, but...Fortunately, Little Queen is rescued at the last moment with the last two songs.  It\\'s comforting ballad time with \"Cry To Me\", where the only instrument is Nancy\\'s acoustic.  The last verse is my favourite:  \"You\\'re lonesome over a stormy Ocean/Lost in the rain and wind/We can clear these clouds away/and feel the Sun again.\"  That segues into \"Go On Cry,\" which starts with a guitar, with strings rising in the background, then drums, a slow bluesy riff.  Ann and Nancy sing the title in harmony over and over.  They would perfect this style ballad in \"Mistral Wind.\"Also noticeable on this album is the absence of Sue Ennis, but that\\'s a few albums away.

Hamlow', 'helpful': [0, 2], 'reviewText': 'OK, I\\'ve finally gotten around to reviewing one of the most popular albums of all-time.  I\\'ve had this for a while but... Definitely Carole King\\'s masterpiece, the thoughtful, comforting, inspiring, and richly-woven Tapestry shows not only her songwriting powers at their best, but proves she was able to turn out inspiring tunes for herself instead of sundry others as she did in the 1960\\'s.  She even does a few of those songs here as well.  And behold the result.  Tapestry yielded no less than four Grammy Awards for 1971:  Album of the Year, Record of the Year for \"It\\'s Too Late\", Song of the Year for \"You\\'ve Got A Friend\", and Pop Female Vocal.  But I see in Tapestry, with its jamming piano and rolling rhythm a template for the sound of the 70\\'s that influenced countless others, such as the Eagles, James Taylor, Linda Ronstadt, and Karla Bonoff.That familiar jamming keyboard starting off \"I Feel The Earth Move\" whose catchy rhythm will make one feel \"as mellow as the month of May\" if it catches one in the right frame of mind, of course.  It maintains an upbeat jamming until the song\\'s end, when the tempo gradually winds down.  Martika and more recently Mandy Moore are at least two artists who have covered this song.\"So Far Away\" is a slow, thoughtful, introspective song, well, \"one more song about the highway\" asking \"doesn\\'t anybody stay in one place any more?\"  Carole is on piano, and her friend James Taylor on guitar.Then comes the Grammy-winner \"It\\'s Too Late\" which is basically about how two people tried, but \"something inside has died,\" and all from being \"light and breezy\" down to \"look[ing] so unhappy.\"  The key here is that something inside happened to one of the party, \"or maybe we\\'ve just both stopped trying.\"  Gloria Estefan covered this on her cover songs album, Hold Me Thrill Me.One of my favourites here is \"Home Again,\" about wanting to return home and having someone to talk to after being on the road.  If Carole King was my psychiatrist, she\\'d give me an F for not following the mindset adopted in \"Beautiful.\"  She\\'s clearly wondered why people are always sad but she believes that one is as beautiful as one feels.  In that case, I\\'m ugly down to the bone at times.  However, she comes up with an answer:  \"maybe love can end the madness/maybe not, oh, but we can only try.\"  I\\'m still skeptical at her belief that a smile will get people to treat you better.\"Way Over Yonder\" is a search for a true utopia without troubles, a place of \"the sweet tasting good life.\"  The sun shining down is nice, with the rivers of honey having some biblical connotations.  \"A garden of wisdom from long ago dream\", huh?  When\\'s the next train?The universally ever-inspiring \"You\\'ve Got A Friend\" would definitely have a place in my top 100 songs.  This came out the same year as James Taylor\\'s version.  Apart from Carole\\'s piano and Taylor\\'s guitar, there\\'s  an accompanying string quartet.  Ofra Haza did a cover of this on her last album but it didn\\'t top this rendition.  The words of the chorus are immortal, but my mind latches on to this particular verse:  \"Ain\\'t it good to know that you\\'ve got a friend/when people can be so cold/they\\'ll hurt you and desert you/and take your soul if you let them/oh, but don\\'t you let them.\"\"Where you lead I will follow\" goes the chorus on \"Where You Lead\" on this nice number on emotional fealty.  Simple but comforting lyrics.The oft-covered \"Will You Love Me Tomorrow\", originally done by the Shirelles, is done in a mellowed piano ballad, again with help on guitar by James Taylor, without the polish and extra sugar of the original.The most uptempo song here is \"Smackwater Jack\" of someone who loses his head and shoots down the people in a church, only to be captured by a posse, but is hung instead of being brought to trial.  While I note her belief in law and order and the injustice of justice without trial, I wonder if King embodies more traditional values.  What would today\\'s society think of \"You can\\'t talk to a man with a shotgun in his hand?\"  And if one thinks about it, isn\\'t that the mentality which the US had in Iraq last March?  The live version, one of two bonus tracks for the remaster, isn\\'t bad.It\\'s only Carole here on piano with the title track, where she uses a tapestry as a metaphor for her life and that of a man of fortune whose ups and downs she sees in that tapestry.  There\\'s a degree of sadness when the tapestry unravels, just as the song starts to end.  She does her own take of \"(You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman\", making it less brassy than Aretha Franklin\\'s rendition.With a sound that matches the rest of Tapestry, the bonus song \"Out In The Cold\" is a nice afterthought which doesn\\'t spoil an album that\\'s one of the most popular of all time.', 'overall': 5.0, 'summary': 'Carole&#65533;s everlasting tapestry with a rich and royal hue', 'unixReviewTime': 1068681600, 'reviewTime': '11 13, 2003'}, {'reviewerID': 'A2P49WD75WHAG5', 'asin': 'B0000025WQ', 'reviewerName': 'Daniel J.

I wore out the tape of this and had to buy another, the only artist that\\'s had that honour in my collection and for that reason.Despite Madonna being the \"Material Girl\" in 1984, Cyndi proved she could put out a similarly themed song, \"Money Changes Everything\" with the in-vogue synthesizers mixed with Hooters guitarist Eric Bazilian\\'s crunchy lead guitars.  I love this song from the catchy rock rhythm.  The following mirrors 80\\'s yuppie-type business world ethics:  \"They say we\\'ll be your friends/We\\'ll stick with you till the end/Ah but everybody\\'s only looking out for themselves/And you say well, who can you trust.\"  The live version from the promotional 12-inch disc, has Cyndi intro-ing its recording in a typical New Yawk accent.One of Cyndi\\'s two signature tunes, and definitely the more fun.  From the opening synth glissando that ripples from left to right speaker--the effect is best felt on headphones--to the catchy synths and drums that reflects a spirited girl responding to her parents after asking her what she\\'s going to do with her life.  As the line goes, \"When the working day is done/girls, they wanna have fun.  \"The backing girl chorus and pizzicato-like upper range piano synths in the middle are also really neat.She then covers Prince\\'s Dirty Mind song, \"When You Were Mine\", heavy on bass, a slower tempo than the original, bathed in the 80\\'s synth glow.  Although I prefer the original, Cyndi\\'s version is the one I first heard.Then a timeless song that makes my sad chip to go into overdrive, the heartfelt \"Time After Time,\" the #1 song she co-wrote with Hooters keyboardist Rob Hyman:  \"If you\\'re lost you can look and you will find me/time after time/if you fall I will catch you-I\\'ll be waiting/time after time.\"  This featured in Strictly Ballroom, and even Miles Davis did this on his You\\'re Under Arrest album.The grinding safe-sex/autoerotic anthem \"She Bop\" with its impish lyrics still makes me smile after all this time.  It shows Cyndi has got quite some mischief in her:  \"They say I\\'d better stop-or I\\'ll go blind\", \"Do I wanna go out with a lion\\'s roar\"  She even has a playful giggle after mentioning she needs a chaperone.  Included is a lyrical nod to Gene Vincent\\'s \"Be Bop A Lula\".  The live version included has different stylings and false starts, but is still good.\"All Through The Night,\" penned by Aimee Mann\\'s beau Jules Shear with its glittering piano-like synth is yet another winning ballad sung with sheer sensitivity.  The metaphor of the time of the couple has with a ticking meter is interesting, as she says, \"Until it ends, there is no end.\"  There\\'s some vintage 80\\'s synth played during the bridge.  The live version here has differing but worthwhile instrumentation.With the same kind of guitar heard in \"She-Bop\", the catchy \"Witness\" also has Cyndi doing a Ronnie Spector-like \"oh oh oh\".  \"I\\'ll Kiss You\" which details the results of drinking Love Potion #9, has a funky synth and beat and was co-written with Jules Shear.  Her Betty Boop-ish vocals come in handy on the 1929 song \"He\\'s So Unusual\" with duplicated LP hiss, which then segues into the high adrenaline \"Yeah Yeah\" which really showcases her vocal power and comical baby-ish vocal intrusions like \"sushi, I want sushi!\"A vintage 80\\'s classic which makes she bop, he bop, we-bop, and I-bop and be bop a lu she bop whenever I hear it nearly 20 years later.', 'overall': 5.0, 'summary': 'Oh, Cyndi, she still wanna have fun!', 'unixReviewTime': 1060560000, 'reviewTime': '08 11, 2003'}, {'reviewerID': 'A2P49WD75WHAG5', 'asin': 'B0000025YB', 'reviewerName': 'Daniel J.

True enough, but Warrior, the full-length release they spawned, deserves its tribute nearly twenty years after its debut.  I mean, it's got that archetypal 80's rock sound, and that's what I grew up on.The big hit from this album is of course, &quot;The Warrior&quot;, co-written by none other than Holly Knight.  A searing hard-rock, early Bryan Adams-style guitar opens this single, whose memorable chorus goes &quot;Shooting at the walls of heartache/Bang bang, I am the warrior&quot;.  Smyth is really the Amazon here in this song equating capturing someone's love to hunting.  Bit unromantic, really, but then again, Smyth does have a bit of sensuous rough in her, doesn't she?The other single, &quot;Beat Of A Heart&quot; is more laid back rock set by the bass and drums.  Producer Mike Chapman and Holly Knight did the words and music for &quot;Hands Tied&quot; whose rhythm section has that steady pulsing beat reminiscent of &quot;Every Breath You take&quot; or &quot;Missing You&quot;.  Another &quot;seeing an ex with another girl&quot; type song, Smyth's (or rather the narrato's toughness reveals deep down more tender vibes:  &quot;Just remember each time you squeeze her hand, you crush my heart.&quot;  She tells him further that &quot;She may be one good reason to leave [me]/But I'm a hundred reasons to stay.&quot;&quot;Less Than Half&quot; is standard 80's rock-ballad, of a couple the night after, with the tensions described vividly:  &quot;We move in circles/with our eyes on the door/saying so little/thinking much more.&quot;  Yet the woman here decides to stick with the rotter:  &quot;But everything you've ever said was a lie/so pull me closer to your heart that's no good.&quot;The cover of Journey's &quot;Only The Young&quot; is a straight ahead one, but it shows that Patty Smyth had as much oomph as Steve Perry in this song, and I say this when comparing her version with her solo single &quot;Never Enough.&quot;  A standout cut here, and as I was apprised of this by Eric Andrews, another bigup for him.&quot;All I Want&quot; has marching steady guitar riffs and has Smyth smartly telling someone seeking thrills from the street, to stand out alone, that &quot;But now and then you have to see/that it's only you, it's only me.&quot;The lack of communication in &quot;Talk To Me&quot; exposes Smyth's vulnerable side, as she pleads with her dear one to speak to her, saying &quot;Don't you know baby they're trying to break us up?&quot;&quot;Say What You Will&quot; is another somber breakup rock ballad, but the pace picks up with &quot;Tonight&quot; and &quot;Maybe We Went Too Far&quot;, which are mid-paced closers.Produced by Mike Chapman, best known for bringing out the heart of glass in Blondie, so to speak, and who also played a part in Tina Turner's Private Dancer, Scandal was a probing ground for Smyth until her criminally out-of-print solo album, Never Enough.  Scandal's gifted in having a consistent sound which makes up for the lack of other rockers that have the same punch as &quot;The Warrior&quot; or some that are lyrically unmemorable.

Okay, now to determine the definition of &quot;live,&quot; because like all words, &quot;live&quot; can mean anything one wants it to mean.The rocking &quot;Going Down To Liverpool,&quot; sung by drummer Debbi Peterson, is a nod to the Beatles and is the decisive track that tells the listener why the Bangles merit listening to, although for me, I would have been instantly won over on the first song.  Katrina and the Waves would later cover this on their debut album.Susanna Hoffs is my favorite Bangle and she does the lead on &quot;Hero Takes A Fall,&quot; &quot;James,&quot; &quot;Dover Beach,&quot; and &quot;He's Got A Secret,&quot; as well as sharing lead with Vicki on &quot;Tell Me.&quot;  Her voice is sugary but strong.  Vicki definitely has the strongest voice of the quartet.  And bassist Michael Steele doesn't get to sing lead, but that would change on Different Light.However, there are places where the quartet carried on the new wave sound, except with heavier emphasis on rocking guitars rather than bubbly pop, especially on &quot;All About You,&quot; &quot;Tell Me&quot; and &quot;Silent Treatment.&quot;The closing track and ballad, &quot;More Than Meets The Eye,&quot; is a perfect closer to an album that spent most of its 31:10 minutes(!!) rocking for all its worth.

While many serious silent films may consider this a blasphemous take on Lang\\'s film, I\\'ll have to say that was the first time I saw it, with  the blue, green, violet, and red tints, along with a host of songs written by Giorgio Moroder of Donna Summer fame, and the one who gave Berlin their only #1 hit.  Most of the songs have an industrial type sound blare with synths that either pulse or are awash like the red of a glaring sunset.For some reason, the lyrics of \"Love Kills\" listed in the booklet do not match what Mercury sings.  However, the industrialized sound is something akin to Queen\\'s \"Invisible Man.\"  \"Love kills/drills you through your hear/love kills/scars you from the start\" and many such lyrics colour this song.Pat Benatar\\'s ballad \"Here\\'s My Heart\" is my favourite song here, as it was the love theme in the movie.  There is a more pop feel to it, and though it comes three years previously, I can imagine Tiffany doing a remake of this on her first album, minus the Moroder synths.Yes-man Jon Anderson  does \"Cage Of Freedom,\" whose pulsing synths and rock guitars identify this as a classic Moroder-type song.  The song depicts the claustrophobic and desperate condition of the workers and subjects of Metropolis:  \"Cage of freedom, growing smaller/till every wall now touches the skin/cage of freedom/filled with treason/changing sides as the losses begin.\"Another song that deals with the enslaved humans is the haunting choral of Cycle V\\'s \"Blood From A Stone.\"  There are only three verses here, each potent in its lyrical content, which given today\\'s corporate mentality, is apropos:  \"Cold machines that never stop/even if a man should drop/mercy never lets her face be shown/they draw blood from  a stone.\"\"The Legend Of Babel\" is a keyboard instrumental by Giorgio Moroder, meant to conjure a fascinating mindscape or some blinding fantasy vision, sounding like a composition from one of the nineteenth century Romantics.\"Here She Comes\", sings Bonnie Tyler, in a track meant to signify the hypnotic quality the main female lead Maria has.  One verse is meant as an allusion to the robot that substitutes her:  \"If she\\'s the same how come she\\'s different now?\"  Her vocals have her usual powerGiorgio Moroder\\'s sound somehow doesn\\'t fit Loverboy, as \"Destruction\" sounds like a way-slowed down version of \"Turn Me Loose\" with the Moroder synths.  That\\'s only partially true with Billy Squier\\'s \"On Your Own.\"  However, the guitar work, overlayed with synths in some parts, and catchy chorus work well to bring out a man for whom the time has come to free his soul from tyranny.How well do we know people, or the expressions on their face?  \"Can a smile conceal a sneer?\"  \"What makes the truth curl up and lie?\" are two crucial question Adam Ant asks in \"What\\'s Going On,\" a pulsing rocker that depicts the collapse of the dictatorship in Metropolis.\"Machines\" is the second Moroder instrumental, and is a quick-paced exercise in keyboards and pulsing synth beats.The Metropolis soundtrack is a good compilation of songs, no mistake.  Like all soundtrack songs, there are some that can only be understood within the context of the movie it was meant to enhance, such as Bonnie Tyler\\'s song, and there are others that transcend that and can be applied universally.  Within the soundtrack, the artists\\' songs are good;  however, I wouldn\\'t compare this to other works in their oeuvre-they\\'ve done better songs.

That catchy bridge and chorus will always stay with me:  &quot;But you know that I'll forgive you/Just this once...twice...forever/'cause baby, you could drag me to hell and back/Just as long as we're together/And you do....&quot;  Chorus says &quot;I don't want your freedom.../I don't want to play around.../I don't want nobody baby/Part time love just brings me down/I don't want your freedom/Girl, all I want right now is you.&quot;  For sentimental reasons, a classic.A brass opening and a cantering beat characterizes &quot;Credit Card Baby&quot;, who is a materialistic girl using a guy, who's probably got money to spend, as he says, &quot;You can have my credit card baby/But keep your red hot fingers off of my heart lady.&quot;  It amounts to, &quot;Hey, if you want my money, just say so straight out, but don't try to wheedle it out by saying you love me.&quot;  And giving another nod to the &quot;money can't buy you love&quot; theme, there's &quot;Between the ocean and the sky/There are things that you can't buy/And if you look you'll see/One of them is me&quot;A more mid-tempo, relaxing jazz-pop/soul number, &quot;If You Were There&quot; follows.  Closest thing to filler on this album.After &quot;Freedom&quot;, my second favourite is the haunting ballad &quot;Careless Whisper&quot;, on infidelity and the regret that follows.  It's that acoustic guitar during verses, chorus, and sax solo following it that touches me down there:  &quot;I'm never gonna dance again/Guilty feet have got no rhythm/Though it's easy to pretend/I know you're not a fool/I should have known better than to cheat a friend/And waste a chance that I'd been given.&quot;  For other similar melancholy melodies, compare Wham's cover of Was Not Was's &quot;Where Did Your Heart Go&quot; on Music From The Edge Of Heaven and Debbie Gibson's &quot;Foolish Beat.&quot;&quot;Freedom&quot; and the singles from this album, as well as their swansong Music From The Edge Of Heaven became part of my essential 80's music education.\", 'overall': 4.0, 'summary': \"I don't want your freedom... girl all I want is you\", 'unixReviewTime': 1060387200, 'reviewTime': '08 9, 2003'}, {'reviewerID': 'A2P49WD75WHAG5', 'asin': 'B00000266C', 'reviewerName': 'Daniel J.

Oh, and so was I, as I just graduated high school, and one of the things that surprised me was that Wham! was breaking up.  I bought their swansong album, Music From The Edge Of Heaven, which seemed more a prelude to George Michael's solo career, as two songs are credited to him rather than Wham!.The catchy title song shows less soul but more straight pop overladen with trumpet, trombone, and sax.  Deon Estus's throbbing bass also contributes heavily.  This song veers towards the lust end of the spectrum rather than the love songs on Make It Big.:  &quot;I'm a maniac at the end of the day&quot; and &quot;There's a place for us in a dirty movie/'Cos no-one does it better than me and you.&quot;  And I can barely hear Elton John's piano here.The frustrated love song &quot;Battlestations&quot; is accusatory, as the girl is accused of hiding behind her answerphone, and the guy even goes as far as opening her diary.  A real relation on the rocks.  And the cold finishing touch has the girl saying in French that money is her new best friend, so goodbye.  Charming story, huh?&quot;I'm Your Man&quot; is presented in an eight minute plus extended version instead of the single-version.  It's a return to the funky soul that characterized Make It Big.  After about 1:22 of synths, drums, and even racing car noises, the single proper begins.  It's got a catchy and fun beat, but there's a great amount of braggadocio and no love involved:  &quot;I don't need you to care/I don't need you to understand/All I want is for you to be there/.../I'm your man.&quot;  Really romantic, huh?A really case of a partying slacker with bad attitude who'd rather have fun than a job characterizes the bass and horns funk jam of the immature &quot;Wham! Rap '86.&quot;  Michael raps some verses, and sings on the chorus.  And who would imagine George Michael would sing &quot;C'mon everybody, don't need this cr*p&quot;?George Michael's first solo single hit #7 in the US and either #1 or #2 in the UK, showing he had potential solo career potential.  &quot;A Different Corner&quot; is one of the best things I've heard from him.  It's a haunting regret song with bass and light airy keyboards and shows his vulnerable side.  &quot;Take me back in time maybe I can forget/turn a different corner and we never would have met&quot; he sings at one point.  Tie that with &quot;And if all that there is is this fear of being used/I should go back to being lonely and confused/If I could, I would I swear&quot; and you get the gist of this song.  Lonely and confused is something I'd pick given my sensitivity.The next number that's very personal to me,&quot; says George in introducing the live &quot;Blue.&quot;  The narrator here is a hollow husk after being deserted, saying he laughs and smiles less, and even needs someone to tell him where his heart is.  He repeats &quot;Can't you see I'm falling apart?&quot;The nightclub European jazz-like cover of Was (Not Was)'s &quot;Where Did Your Heart Go&quot; is another standout cut, due to Andy Hamilton's wailing sax.  Things really sink to despair, when the river &quot;calls out my name/Says 'put your troubles down beside me.'&quot; and the narrator jumps into the river's beauty.Another song about a delicate and crushed heart set to a well-paced bass and keyboard beat, &quot;Last Christmas&quot; is another George Michael solo.  As he says, &quot;This year, to save me from tears/I'll give it [my heart] to someone special.&quot;Despite some upbeat and heartfelt numbers, there's nothing charming or romantic here on this album, nothing like &quot;Freedom&quot; or &quot;Wake Me Up Before You Go-Go.&quot;  It's just one case of bad love, frustration, and loneliness after another, and it mirrors the dissolution of the duo's partnership.  George Michael made a few more significant marks in pop history, while Andrew Ridgeley married Keren Woodward of Bananarama, and backup singers Pepsi &amp; Shirlie released one solo album which spawned two big hits in the UK, but Wham! primarily served as a vehicle for George Michael's career.\", 'overall': 4.0, 'summary': 'Mixture of bad love, disillusion, and sad songs', 'unixReviewTime': 1060387200, 'reviewTime': '08 9, 2003'}, {'reviewerID': 'A2P49WD75WHAG5', 'asin': 'B00000266K', 'reviewerName': 'Daniel J.

As the song says, &quot;it just takes a beat to turn it around.&quot;  The keyboards are more in tune with the notes rather than the loopy wall of synth on She's So Unusual.  It's still one of the best songs here.  And what really makes this a winning second single is special guest harmony vocals from the Bangles and guitar from Nile Rodgers.The toe-tapping &quot;Maybe He'll Know&quot; features Billy Joel as guest vocalist.  With the programmed Linn drums and keyboards added to something like Del Shannon's &quot;Runaway&quot; or similar 60's song.  Lauper repaid the favour by singing on &quot;Baby Grand&quot; on Joel's The Bridge, also released the same year.The mid-paced &quot;Boy Blue&quot;, was the fourth single, about a lost boy on the streets.  Barely avoids being filler.Another of the 80's prime songwriters, Tom Kelly and Billy Steinberg, give Cyndi Lauper the best song here, the gentle title track, underscored by guitar and soft keyboards.  A classic song of all time despite its crass misuse in Kodak commercials promoting better quality colour.  Rather, it tells one to cheer up despite the dark world.  Cyndi's vocals are the tenderest in the verses.  And when she sings that immortal chorus, Phil Collins later did a decent cover of this as a new track on his Hits CD.Rick Derringer gives Cyndi some co-writing and guitar hoochie-coo in &quot;Calm Inside The Storm&quot; in this rollicking &quot;I'll be your emotional support-type song.&quot;  &quot;I'm like a rockin' ship/on your rollin' sea/you know crash lightin' never frightens me, nah.&quot;She does two decent cover songs next, the first being Marvin Gaye's protest song extolling the virtues of racial brotherhood and peace amidst the dying days of the Civil Rights Movement and continued conflict in Vietnam, &quot;What's Going On.&quot;  She conveys the poignancy of the song very well.  Guest guitarist are Adrian Belew and 'til tuesday's Robert Holmes.  That segues into the Dixie Cups' &quot;Iko Iko&quot;, the original of which later got renewed popularity following its use in Rain Man.  Cyndi's rendition makes it more a campfire sound.Another upbeat song, &quot;The Faraway Nearby&quot; has yet another guest vocalist.  I'll give you 'til tuesday to figure out who.  If you guessed Aimee Mann, ten points to whatever house you belong to.Unfortunately, the last two songs shows the creativity sapping.  &quot;911&quot; tries to emulate something from her She's So Unusual era but the different sound plays havoc with it, and Pee-Wee Herman's contribution at the end of the song as the phone operator is pointless.  &quot;One Track Mind&quot; is a throwaway track.  These two songs is why I can't give this five stars like I did its predecessor.Not as wild as She's So Unusual, True Colors shows a less crazy Lauper, but one whose unique sweet Betty Boop-ish vocals have developed to become more tender (True Colors) and poignant (What's Going On).  Still, on the better tracks, Cyndi acquits herself above average, thanks to her vocal talent and help from some friends.\", 'overall': 4.0, 'summary': \"Mostly good followup to She's So Unusual\", 'unixReviewTime': 1060905600, 'reviewTime': '08 15, 2003'}, {'reviewerID': 'A2P49WD75WHAG5', 'asin': 'B00000266N', 'reviewerName': 'Daniel J.

Aimee Mann's voice is stronger here, but with just as much feeling.The two singles, &quot;What About Love&quot; and &quot;Coming Up Close&quot; are good openers.  &quot;What About Love&quot; seemed more accessible.  &quot;Coming Up Close&quot; shows 'til tuesday's slight dip in the waters of country.  I wonder if any female country musicians have covered this tune--lyrically and thematically, it has the right feel for a country ballad.&quot;David Denies&quot; and &quot;Lover's Day&quot; are two examples.  &quot;Lover's Day&quot; demonstrates how high a register Aimee Mann can go one moment and then drop down very low.  It's also one of the stronger songs on the album.&quot;Sleeping And Waking&quot; has an opening melody that would later be utilized in &quot;Fifty Years After The Fair&quot; from Aimee Mann's Whatever.&quot;Angels Never Call&quot; is curiously the first 'til tuesday where it is a woman being sung about instead of a man.  The verse &quot;angels never help you/because angels always fall&quot; might as well proceed from the saying &quot;What goes up, must come down.&quot;  So, Satan is not the only fallen angel.

Unfortunately, they fell into the trap of the sophomore slump and the tertiary collapse, after which they dissolved.  Pity, really, since not only do I enjoy all three of their albums, but I consider this, their third and final album, released in 1988, to be their best accomplishment ever, even better than Aimee Mann's solo debut, Whatever.  Call it a well-aged bottle of pleasing melancholy that keeps getting better.The songs here are more wistful than downright sad as in Voices Carry, and have a more radio-friendly beat instead of a depressing dirge.  No, it doesn't make one want to look for something sharp after listening to Type O Negative or Black Tape For A Blue Girl, but after listening to Everything's Different Now, you feel refreshed but want to take a nap to digest all that melancholy.The title track, &quot;Rip In Heaven,&quot; and &quot;'J' For Jules&quot; are prime examples of that bittersweet melancholy.  Like popster Kim Wilde, Aimee Mann is a sage of lost love and times when things weren't so sad.  Her voice is more polished here and the group more tight-knit, so there was no reason they couldn't have continued through the early 1990's, despite the explosion of the Seattle sound.  Music buyers, thy name is fickle.She is a great lyricist too.  In &quot;Rip In Heaven,&quot; she writes how fragile a creature optimism is:  &quot;optimistic feelings can't be/passed from hand to hand/You handle them/they tend to die.&quot;  When she sings &quot;We both know we had a past/but present must contain/a future where both of us can fit&quot;, she exemplifies the introspective rational who sees the present as an interval between past and present.&quot;'J' For Jules&quot; is a song about her then-beau, music producer Jules Shear.  She compares her relationship to a country.  It's classic; it begins happy, there's that country beginning with 'J', then the bridge, where &quot;there's no way a country could die/told me they drift away/but that's a lie&quot; and the end of the country, which only exists in her heart.It's magical when I pick up words and think, oh yes, that's the story of my life.  The single &quot;(Believed You Were) Lucky&quot; begins with a guitar that preempts the hopelessness and resignation of the opening lines.  When I hear, &quot;So I guess I'll give it up/yeah I guess I will/What's the use in pushing/when it's all uphill&quot;, I hear a familiar soundtrack that's gone through my life.  The chorus goes:  &quot;I wish you believed in life/believed in fate/believed you were lucky/and worth the wait/'cause life could be lovely/Life could be so great.&quot;  Alas, this poor soul only wishes he did.Another example are lines in &quot;Long Gone (Buddy)&quot;:  &quot;Nobody wants to be happier more than I do/But happiness I must confess/I don't have&quot; and &quot;It's not that I'm frightened of being alone/It's just that I know what a burden this grief can be.&quot;  Loneliness does carry freedom as a reward, but grief as a consequence.My favorite song?  &quot;The Other End (Of The Telescope)&quot;, which features guest vocals by Elvis Costello.  It could be sung in front of a campfire, but after a few beers, when the sad stage of being drunk sets in.  But there are a whole lot of others that are nipping at its heels, like the other songs I have already mentioned.There are many things I still wonder to this day.

Desmond Child's songwriting can be felt here.  In some ways, I'm reminded of a slowed down &quot;Heaven's On Fire,&quot; a song he did for KISS.  That song and &quot;Ridin' With James Dean&quot; shows Joan's shift to arena rock, with crashing guitar theatrics and riffs.  &quot;Back It Up&quot; even has shades of Def Leppard.  Given that Hysteria was released the previous year, it's hardly surprising that incorporating that sort of sound was seen as a boon.The other single from here shows how Joan can exhibit the vulnerable and hurt apart from the anger from being lied to.  &quot;Little Liar&quot; exudes all three in this rock ballad, with a choral backing and rhythm guitar that makes this more an 80's Heart song.  Like the other single, this highlights Desmond Child's co-writing talents.  But it also makes me ask, &quot;Joan, do you any NICE guys instead of ones who treat you like cr-p?&quot;Joan does two cover songs back-to-back.  The first is Chuck Berry's rollicking &quot;Tulane.&quot;  See, that's the thing about a Jett album.  It's anticipating what she'll cover in a sea of original numbers that makes it fun.  The other is a moody, paced, chugging rendition of Iggy Pop's &quot;I Wanna Be Your Dog,&quot; with enough power guitar to make it worthwhile.The mid-paced rocker &quot;You Want In, I Want Out,&quot; also co-written with Desmond Child, has a sound that mirrors KISS, Crazy Nights era, minus the Ron Nevison wall of synth, but with the arena rock backing vocals of Heart.&quot;Just Like In The Movies&quot; has that classic Jett bite, sporting an electric bluesy guitar that belongs on the first album.  And ace songwriter Diane Warren helps Joan and producer Kenny Laguna on the 60's-pop inspired &quot;Desire,&quot; which sounds quite nice with the usual guitars and backing vocals, also 60's-inspired, a sound also found in the more tempered but listenable &quot;Play that Song Again.&quot;This is the first album since drummer Lee Crystal and bassist Gary Ryan's departure following Good Music, replaced here by Thommy Price and Kasim Sulton respectively.

Gone were the hauntingly ethereal synths that marked Tongues and Tails.  Instead, one got bits of dance pop and stylish ballads which effectively served for some quality vocal delivery from SBH.  And the songs here are more romantic and optimistic compared to T&T;, with some soaring vocals put to good use over some somewhat exotic albeit indulgent synths I\\'ve never seen since Heart\\'s Ron Nevison-produced albums!The highest charting single was the sweet lullaby-like ballad \"As I Lay Me Down,\" peaking at #6, and spending six long weeks atop the Adult Contemporary Charts.  Airy synths accompany the keyboards and guitars to create a more radio-friendly sound.  Having said that, it\\'s a mystery why other singleworthy tracks flopped.Possible answer:  \"It\\'s not a matter it\\'s a matter of taste,\" raps Sophie in the bridge\\'s monologue of the opening track, \"Right Beside You\" opening with exotic space-age synths and keyboard fills, and techno beat that would\\'ve been right at home on a Human League or Pet Shop Boys album, with some frantic accompaniment by Sophie.  #54 is way too low for a song that deserved Top 5 status.The life-affirming \"The Ballad of Sleeping Beauty,\" also known as \"Only Love,\" made it to #49, a number of mid-paced energy, is another 80\\'s-like synth number with Sophie\\'s distinctive stylings, rapid-fire subconscious lyrics in the prechorus, and catchy choruses:  \"only love can purify, only love can conquer fear, only love can make a miracle of life.\"  The rapid-fire material does include all the cycles one goes through-\"I want the loss I want the pain I want to start my life again\", and the many personas embodied with a woman:  \"I am the child I am the whore I am the wild woman at your door\"  In looking at the original lyrics, I see she substituted \"you effed with my head, you effed with the dead, now I\\'m gonna eff with you\" with \"you messed etc.\"  Curious.But it was the sheer danceability of \"Don\\'t Don\\'t Tell Me No.\"  A truly romantic number, tender at times, oozing of that nave spring love.  It\\'s that rapid-fire layered echoing vocals going \"never let it go\" near the end that really get me, but also some innuendo:  \"this is our world awaiting for the sweetest penetrating love we have found.  Why can\\'t we splatter it around and around?\"  Whoa!  Another on the same line is \"Let Me Love You Up\" where she incorporates some breathy yet playful French lyrics.A primeval jungle-like theme, with horn flourishes and some funk is prominent in \"Swing From Limb To Limb\" of going back to nature in terms of love, doing it like the monkeys in the jungle.  The tearfully romantic ballad \"True Romance\" truly highlights Hawkins\\' vocals, consisting of airy synths, keyboards without any drum machines.  Another highlight of this album.  \"Sometimes I See\" sports a loungy jazz sound.The heaviest song in terms of theme is \"I Need Nothing Else,\" where the rough and tumble and yet the softer side of love is explored, and how the protagonist accepts both-\"in you I see the brightest star that burns inside me and breaks my heart.\"  The yin to the yang, in other words.This was on heavy play at the music store where I worked, and its highlights really grew on me.

There are some engaging rocking songs and Keith Scott is still on board, but without the power chops that made Reckless such a hit.  This is a more mellowed work, with some sobering topics that probably wouldn\\'t have most music buyers scrambling to get this album.  That\\'s too bad for them, because that\\'s exactly what makes this album a wonder.\"Heat Of The Night\" was the first single of the album, and there\\'s a bluesy lean towards the song.  This was the only Top Ten single from Into The Fire.The title track is a light philosophical rocker on life and its pains, and is a sure sign of the maturity he embarked on during his later albums.  He\\'s a stark realist, given, \"You could wait for your dreams to come true/but time has no mercy/time won\\'t stand still for you.\"  The title lyric has similar tones:  \"Well, I know what your heart desires/but you can\\'t take it with you into the fire.\"Those who\\'ve been given the shaft on love will find their song on the third single, \"Victim Of Love\", which is my favourite song here.  The part where the guitars stop with only the quiet percussion, makes the song wistful with Bryan\\'s voice, which is down to a softened and tender rasp.  Other times, he screams as if to stifle the pain.  Love this lyric:  \"It\\'s a table for one and a broken heart to go.\"  Keith Scott\\'s fiery guitar does wonders in this rock ballad.The stripped down but engaging \"Another Day\" is a somber look at the day-to-day look at the perils of unemployment.  As the song opens, the protagonist has spent his unemployment check, probably on drink, as he can\\'t remember the previous night, and has bills to pay.  However, he does sound a bit callous and fed up when he says \"Some people never learn/their life ain\\'t my concern.\"After Iron Maiden and Europe, now it\\'s Bryan Adams\\' turn to do a song on the injustices done to Native Americans with the sobering ballad \"Native Son\".  Sung from the POV of an elderly Native, it tells of a time \"before the wagons - before the soldiers\\' guns.\"  There is anger-\"like dogs we were driven from this place\" and sadness-\"With each new day that comes to pass/will the Great Spirit free us all at last?\"  in the song.\"Only The Strong Survive\"  has stylings of 60\\'s rock on the verses, something like the Easybeats, and the title refers to the perils of the fast life.\"Rebel\" is a look at the title character who returns to the town he left to be different.  The rocking guitar melody has similarities to \"Piano Man.\"  He\\'s caught between his situation now and his past days, but in the end, those \"two worlds collide in a moment of truth.\"\"Remembrance Day\" is the Commonwealth equivalent of Veteran\\'s Day, 11 November, and has Adams tackling those who laid down their lives fighting that war to end all wars.  It\\'s a somber ballad that puts paid the macho image of war-\"We\\'d face the fighting with a smile-or so we said/if only we had known what danger lay ahead.\"  \"Well the guns will be silent/there\\'ll be no more fighting/oh, we\\'ll lay down our weapons/on remembrance day\" goes the chorus.  That brings to mind how actions put weight behind words of \"no more fighting.\"  Indeed, there was another world war twenty-one years afterwards.  How many times will we say that, I wonder?The second single was \"Hearts On Fire\", which is a lightweight cousin of something that would\\'ve ended up on Reckless, which explains why it was released as a single, only to fall far below Adams\\' previous Top Ten glory.I wonder if the protagonist from \"Rebel\" experienced the feelings of wanting to go \"Home Again\", because I can picture him singing this first, before moving to the events in \"Rebel.\"  In this song, he\\'s going back home to the girl he left behind.This was the second album Adams produced with Bob Clearmountain.  His next co-pilot would be someone who\\'d given Def Leppard two hit albums and would become Mr. Shania Twain in the next decade.

Like Tony Manero in Saturday Night Fever, \"when she\\'s dancin\\'/[it\\'s] just her heart and her soul and her fantasies.\"  Lou Gramm of Foreigner helps out on background vocals here.\"Run To You\" tells the story of a guy torn between two women, one who\\'s loyal and true but with a love that\\'s cold, the other being the one he\\'ll run to.  It\\'s veers between ballad-style rock and intense hard rock, particularly Scott\\'s guitar riffs before Adams sings the chorus to the end.Now, my favourite song here.  \"Heaven\" proves Adams can do wonderful ballads, and he does piano here.  The guitars and drums kick in at the chorus.

Basically, it\\'s the story of a guy who started a band with his friends, saw some of them quit, until he himself met a girl.  Things didn\\'t work out, and he wonders why.  \"Oh when I look back now/That summer seemed to last forever/And if I had the choice/Yeah, I\\'d always wanna be there/Those were the best days of my life\", he affirms.  I detect a real tear in his heart there.  If I could go back...\"Kids Wanna Rock\" is one of the two most ferocious songs here and he rails against disco and new wave in a song whose intensity rivals punk.  \"For a couple of bucks you get a weird haircut and waste your life away.\"  Well, yeah, I noticed the weird haircuts, but there wasn\\'t anything wrong with them.  I still love the intensity of this song.And then, the song that introduced me to Bryan, via Ms. Turner, \"It\\'s Only Love.\"\"Long Gone\" is a humorous take on a bad situation, where in a divorce, all he gets is the clothes on his back.  However, he says, \"But in a matter of time/she\\'ll back for the rest of me,\" the reasoning behind that being \"sooner or later she\\'s gotta realize/that all my feelin\\'s were for real.\"The last song, \"Ain\\'t Gonna Cry\", rivals \"Kids Wanna Rock\" in magnitude.  What kind of girl is he singing about?  How about one where he says \"I needed you like a disease.\"  Whoa!  He also veers towards a bit of rough when he sings, \"Next time maybe re-arrange your face.\"  So for those of you who\\'ve rid themselves of unwanted girlfriends, remember this:  \"I ain\\'t gonna cry over you/You\\'re history--history.\"  Yeah!  Some wild \"yee-ha\"\\'s echo during the fiery last minute, which ends in some Hendrix-style theatrics.This spawned at least five singles and was the beginning of Bryan Adams\\' reign of greatness, until he became synonymous with mawkishly sentimentally ballads.

Yes, there are some tracks which use more instruments but she alone is the figurehead and captain of this ship, The Solitude Standing.The &#65533;Tom&#65533;s Diner&#65533; here is an a capella portrait of her observations at the title place, be it rude waiters who only fills her coffee halfway or the woman who seems to be looking at Vega through the window but only sees her own reflection, symbolizing the insular nature of people.This is quite an unusual song to become a single, as it deals with the POV of an abused child.  but &#65533;Luka&#65533; was a hit in painting a portrait of low self-esteem, a bit shy.  &#65533;I guess I like to be alone/with nothing broken, nothing thrown&#65533; he says.  The two refrains are equally poignant:  &#65533;You just don&#65533;t argue anymore&#65533; and &#65533;Just don&#65533;t ask me how I am.&#65533;  Only Vega could do this song.&#65533;Ironbound/Fancy Poultry&#65533; is a portrait of the city and a woman takes her child to the schoolyard before going to the market.  The way the poultry parts are described seems to be an observation of how we only look at certain parts of people and not the whole:  &#65533;breasts and thighs and hearts/backs are cheap/and wings are nearly free.&#65533;The slightly more uptempo &#65533;In The Eye&#65533; is a song addressed to a would-be mugger or armed assailant.  Instead of fleeing, she sings &#65533;I would live inside of you/I&#65533;d make you wear me/like a scar.&#65533;  This is reminiscent of when the Doctor in Dr. Who says to a would-be gunman, &#65533;So look me in the eye, pull the trigger, end my life&#65533; to which the gunman loses his nerve.  A standout cut.&#65533;And she turns to me with her hand extended/Her palm is split with a flower with a flame.&#65533;  With a pulsing bass and upbeat guitar, the title track is one of my favourite songs here, as it personifies solitude.  The lyrics are sung more quickly than the other tracks and there&#65533;s a sense of haunting introversion here.  &#65533;She says &#65533;I&#65533;ve come to lighten this dark heart&#65533;/And she takes my wrist, I feel her imprint of fear/And I say &#65533;I&#65533;ve never thought of finding you here.&#65533;&#65533;Calypso&#65533; is based on the nymph who was Odysseus&#65533;s lover until he decided to leave her after years with her, and the song tells of the loneliness she&#65533;ll feel:  &#65533;I have let him go/in the dawn he sails away/to be gone forever more.&#65533;The way language can be distorted is the meaning behind the philosophical &#65533;Language&#65533;, where silence is more eloquent than any word.  &#65533;I&#65533;d like to meet you in a timeless/placeless place/Somewhere out of context/and beyond all consequences,&#65533; she sings.&#65533;Gypsy&#65533; with its poetic imagery of &#65533;coffeeshops and morning streets&#65533; is a loving acoustic number of the title character, someone from afar who spins gauzy tales.  The song indicates a sad parting:  &#65533;And we&#65533;ll blow away forever soon/and go on to different lands.&#65533;The haunting &#65533;Wooden Horse (Caspar Hauser&#65533;s Song)&#65533;, replete with drums and bass and Vega&#65533;s quiet voice, seems to be about the mysterious German youth who had been penned up all his life in a cabin without social contact until age 16, with a wooden horse being one of the toys he had with him.  Apparently, his father was a cavalry officer.  Hauser was later murdered under mysterious circumstances.  The realization of the boy&#65533;s fantasies in the afterlife is seen here:  &#65533;But when I&#65533;m dead/if you could tell them this/that what was wood became alive.&#65533;  The album ends with an instrumental of &#65533;Tom&#65533;s Diner.&#65533;A collection of mellow, acoustic folk which added a quieter shade of music in the 80&#65533;s.  However, I couldn&#65533;t help but notice the date on some these songs, many of them before the album&#65533;s release date of 1987. &#65533;Gypsy&#65533; and &#65533;Calypso&#65533; were written in 1978, if that gives one an idea.

The next step would be Abacab, but before that, lead singer and drummer Phil Collins would release his first solo album, Face Value, an album of longing that also details the emotional wasteland of a sundered relationship.  As if to test the waters, he did a more pop updating of \"Behind The Lines,\" originally on Duke, with speeded up vocals and a snazzy brass section (as opposed to the soundscape of Tony Banks\\' keyboards, such as the instrumental opening) that would become a calling card on his subsequent solo albums.Two singles from that album both reached #19 on the charts.  The first one was the upbeat \"I Missed Again,\" highlighted by a strong brass section.  The other, \"In The Air Tonight,\" a UK #2, is one of Collins\\' signature tunes, with its moody and atmospheric keyboards highlighted by Collins\\' haunting vocals, and the snarl of Daryl Steurmer\\'s guitar.  The chorus itself has an eerie echoing effect that matches the minimalist sound, as does the electronic gimmickery of the vocals.  The song and sound then burst to a crescendo when Collins lets loose with the drums through the rest of the song.There are other surprises present, such as the instrumental \"Droned,\" which begins with a slow piano and violins, an airy soundscape, before going full throttle with an uptempo conga and piano section, the violin turning more folky, and Collins\\' vocalizing proving that Peter Gabriel doesn\\'t have the monopoly on droning vocals.  That yields to \"Hand In Hand,\" beginning as a sci-fi Giorgio Moroder-type instrumental (think Metropolis soundtrack) that features the Children from the Church of LA as a choir, before launching into an uptempo brass and piano soul number.  \"I\\'m Not Moving\" is the closest thing to disco Collins would do until \"Something Happened On The Way To Heaven\" nearly a decade later,One of the other highlights is the piano and strings of the post-breakup tune \"You Know What I Mean,\" the emotional devastation which can be felt:  \"leave me alone with my heart/I\\'m putting the pieces back together again/just leave me alone with my dreams/I can do without you...\"  \"If Leaving Me Is Easy,\" with its sad sax, is another melancholy song along the same vein, but this time through the presence of old letters and the false front one put with friends.  Collins\\' pain is felt through the strained vocals, as he sagely sings the refrain in an eerie falsetto, \"if leaving me is easy, going back is harder.\"\"The Roof Is Leaking\" details the hardships of a rural family living in poverty, but with the hope of the coming spring.  Daryl Steurmer is on banjo here instead of his usual guitar.  Other songs are more optimistic, such as the slower and leisurely melodic \"This Must Be Love.\"  My opinion on his cover of the Beatles\\' LSD-influenced \"Tomorrow Never Knows\" is mixed, as nothing compares to the original, but I do credit him with the swirling noise and sound bursts that duplicate another kind of trip.  And if one listens carefully at the fade-out, he sings a snatch of \"Over The Rainbow.\"At this point, Phil Collins had enough to create a different sound from the one he was doing with Genesis, and it shows in his wondrous solo debut.', 'overall': 5.0, 'summary': 'Feel it coming in the air tonight, oh lord!', 'unixReviewTime': 1120780800, 'reviewTime': '07 8, 2005'}, {'reviewerID': 'A2P49WD75WHAG5', 'asin': 'B000002IG4', 'reviewerName': 'Daniel J.

Hello, I Must Be Going was a clear indication of the Earth, Wind, & Fire type soul-pop that would yield the Grammy-winning No Jacket Required.  For the most part, gone were the \"weird\" songs like \"In The Air Tonight\" or the cover of \"Tomorrow Never Knows.\" His note-for-note cover of the Supremes\\' \"You Can\\'t Hurry Love,\" which went to #10, is ample evidence of the pop/soul direction that would hit pay dirt later on.  It\\'s still infectious and has its place in the 80\\'s, a decade and a half before the original hit #1.The closest thing to \"In The Air Tonight,\" with the airy synths, is \"Thru These Walls,\" of how loneliness feeds upon the need to listen with a glass to the wall or stare out at the window at goings on, where a genuine need to touch someone isn\\'t an option in the cold world.  Next up is the disgust and apathy of being ridiculed and having one\\'s name dragged in the dirt of \"I Don\\'t Care Anymore,\" which made it to #39.  However, there was none of the haunting eeriness which made \"Air\" a hit.  The slow \"Do You Know Do You Care\" has a droning synth and guitars, with Collins\\' vocals overlaid on that airy soundscape.  It sounds more like later day Genesis, come to think of it.The third single, the upbeat \"I Cannot Believe It\\'s True,\" only made it to #79 despite the snazzy horns.  This is puzzling given how similar-sounding singles by him shot to the Top Ten in later years.  The Phenix Horns, his brass band, gives this song, and others like \"It Don\\'t Matter To Me\" quite the kick.Two piano ballads are \"Don\\'t Let Him Steal Your Heart Away,\" which gains a bit of momentum with his steady drumming, the strings matching the pounded piano chords, and the sad but tender \"Why Can\\'t It Wait Till Morning,\" which is Phil on piano, the strings, and nothing else.  Another singleworthy song and one of my favourites here.Collins was also at the producer\\'s helm this time, with assistance from Hugh Padgham, the brains behind Face Value and the Police\\'s Synchronicity, and would continue with him in his Grammy-winning triumph.  And Daryl Steurmer, whose snarling guitar would be most noticeable in \"Don\\'t Lose My Number,\" has guitar chores here.Whereas Face Value showed many sides of Collins, this is basically a prelude to the hit that No Jacket Required would become.  Maybe call this No Vest Required?  Yet one can\\'t help but think that Collins\\' solo success also fed upon the success of his group.  Following this, Genesis would gain their first Top Ten hit with \"That\\'s All,\" and during that time, Collins would pave the way to superstardom with a few non-album hits and some big events.

No Jacket Required signified Phil Collins\\' peak, but there had been a lot in the making.  Following Hello I Must Be Going, he made another album with his bandmates Genesis, who went further into the mainstream with the #6 hit \"That\\'s All\" from their eponymous album.  Phil also scored a #1 hit with the poignant \"Against All Odds,\" from the movie of that same name, and a #2 duet with Earth Wind and Fire member Phil Bailey with \"Easy Lover,\" and he played drums on Band-Aid\\'s \"Do They Know It\\'s Christmas\" charity single.Riding on the crest of that wave, \"Sussudio\" the first single from NJR, became Collins\\' second #1 hit.  The infectiously skippy percussion, synths, and horns feature Hugh Padgham\\'s pneumatic pop production honed for greatness.  Another song of that caliber is the energetic \"Who Said I Would,\" a live version of which didn\\'t do so well.  This is easily another Top Five hit.\"Only You Know and I Know\" is by far the most energetic number here, with the breakneck keyboards and horns, accompanied by Phil\\'s resonant and nasally singing, and arguably something that could\\'ve skipped its way on the pop charts, or better still, the dance charts.\"One More Night\" a moody, heartfelt and airy ballad was yet another chart-topper for Collins, aptly demonstrating a frailty and insecurity felt by men.  Most poignant and a case for his songwriting skills is this:  \"I\\'ve been sitting here so long, wasting time, just staring at the phone, and I was wondering should I call you, then I thought maybe you\\'re not alone.\"  I freely indulge in that hesitancy as well.  And thanks to my old manager, Nick Jasken, for pointing out that lyric to me.Of the singles, I\\'m quite taken with \"Don\\'t Lose My Number,\" not only because of the funny video which had Phil doing parodies of Mad Max, David Lee Roth, and the fly in the Cars\\' \"You Might Think,\" but because of the strong drum machine and Daryl Steurmer\\'s snarling rock guitar.  In fact it\\'s only because a guy in the video who asked who was playing the guitar that I learned Daryl Steurmer\\'s name.

Your heart\\'s on your sleeve, but your sleeve is rolled up\"-and fragility of togetherness leads Phil asking \"Does Anybody Stay Together Anymore.\"With the steady drum machine and some light keyboard work, the last Top Ten single, the reflective #7 \"Take Me Home\" is to Phil what \"Watching The Wheels\" was to John Lennon, someone hanging back, withdrawn from the scene but still aware of what\\'s going on.  Helping out Phil on backing vocals is the familiar droning and echoing of Peter Gabriel and Sting, as well as Helen Terry, who sung on Culture Club\\'s \"Church of the Poison Mind.\"The parting of old friends, one for a better life ahead is contained in the piano ballad \"We Said Hello Goodbye.\"  This won the Grammy for Best Album for 1985, but the spillover would continue into Genesis\\'s next album, Invisible Touch.  And Phil kept the fire burning by scoring another #1 hit, \"Separate Lives\" from White Nights, and playing at both Live Aid concerts on the same day.

It describes the degeneration of an affair from Monday morning (&quot;You look so fine&quot;) to Friday (&quot;I got traveling on my mind&quot;), and the crazy cycle that returns back to Monday.  &quot;You only want me when I get over you&quot;, sings Lindsey Buckingham.Christine McVie's sweet &quot;Warm Ways&quot; displays the higher-octave silky warmth she would later bring in on future songs like &quot;You Make Lovin' Fun&quot;, &quot;Everywhere&quot; and &quot;Songbird.&quot;Even before the breakups and bittersweetness that would later emerge in Rumours, in comes the rocking &quot;Blue Letter&quot; made engaging by Lindsey Buckingham's guitar.This song alone is worth buying the album.  It's about a girl who &quot;rings like a bell thru the night/and wouldn't you love to love her.&quot;  &quot;Rhiannon&quot; narrowly missed the Top Ten but was one of three singles that proved that the Mac was a potent force to reckon with.

Lyrically and rhythmically it\\'s tighter and punchier.  The song has a line where he wants to be some overarching expression of love, where he sings, \"I wanna be your brother/I wanna be your mother and sister, too.\"  It\\'s sexually charged in one part.  This is the full 5:47 version and not the single edit, meaning there\\'s an extended instrumental section.  I wonder if there\\'s a 12\" mix of this available.The other single, \"Why You Wanna Treat Me So Bad?\" is another out-and-out synthesizer dance number, articulated with some rock guitar chords, kind of an expansion of what he did in \"I\\'m Yours\".  I like this better than \"I Wanna Be Your Lover\".  A rock guitar solo, more closer to Hendrix, is included.  More shades of Purple Rain.The upbeat stuff continues with \"Sexy Dancer\", which has simple lyrics, about the effects of what that sexy dancer has on him:  \"Sexy dancer, you got my body screaming\" etc.  One line is more explicit than the others.  Some panting is included here, as well as monologue, something he would use in many of his future songs.\"When We\\'re Dancing Close And Slow\" is a contrast to the previous three floor-burners.  It\\'s closer to a nocturne, featuring a quiet acoustic guitar, piano, and drum.\"With You\" is more a Lionel Richie-type radio ballad than \"Close And Slow\" is, as there\\'s a constant synthesizer backing.  It\\'s more a romantic tune without the sex references in \"Closer And Slow\".The rock-guitar tinged \"Bambi\", is surprising coming from someone who advocates sexual openness like him.  The title character is a lesbian and he screams out the chorus: \"Bambi, can\\'t you understand?/Bambi, it\\'s better with a man.\"The piano-dominant ballad \"Still Waiting\" is the trials of a man waiting for that true love to come around.  A similar sound would be used in \"Gotta Broken Heart Again\" on his next album.The mid-paced third single, \"I Feel For You\" had its start here before Chaka Khan took it to the Top Ten in 1984.  With the layer of moog-synthesizers, I definitely prefer this version.A single edit of the 5:30 \"It\\'s Gonna Be Lonely\" could\\'ve made this a good radio ballad.  I like this lyric:  \"I\\'d be in a messed-up state of blue.\"Like Prince, this was another one-man production, yet the fact that he thanks Bobby Z, Andre Cymone, Dez Dickerson, Gayle Chapman, and Matt Fink, who comprised his band, indicates that he may have had some kind of help from them.

The second planet after Claire is Wild Planet, and also the second album by the Athens, GA (then) quintet.  On their second go-around, the B-52\\'s still have the punchy, kitschy/positive/optimistic surf guitar sound and attitude that made their debut an unqualified hit.Here\\'s my piece in describing Wild Planet\\'s nine satellites.  Fred Schneider\\'s \"Surprise!\" is the first word of \"Party Out Of Bounds.\"  Kate and Cindy then ask for the ice box and punch, and there\\'s the party started, right there.  \"Private Idaho\" is Wild Planet\\'s \"Rock Lobster,\" being Wild Planet\\'s most well-known track.  Ricky Wilson\\'s guitar keeps the pace.  \"You\\'re living in your own private Idaho/On a ground like a wild potato.\" This is another on the short list for a party mix-tape should \"Rock Lobster\" not be available for any reason.For sheer jamming, nothing beats \"Devil In My Car\" and \"Strobe Light.\"  The first is a funny song on a car possessed by the devil.  The saying \"Drive like hell and you will get there\" comes to mind.  Anyway, the hapless narrator can\\'t lock the door, or put on my safety belt and is going 90 mph.  He thus cries out \"Help!  The devil\\'s in my car!\"  The humor\\'s very kitschy, with devilish motifs such as \"I don\\'t wanna go to hell\" and \"I don\\'t need no batteries/I\\'ve got the devil in my car.\"\"Strobe Light\" is a seduction number, focusing on making love under the title appliance.  No one sings about kissing body parts and responding to the same as Fred and the girls, respectively.  When he gets to a very personal part of his date\\'s body, he uses a euphemism that\\'s the same as a certain large fruit.  A shrill synthesizer blasts in response.\"Quiche Lorraine\" deserves mention here, about a man and his dog, Quiche the poodle.  The dog runs away after a German Shepherd, leaving the man broken-hearted and vindictive for being abandoned.  In addition to backing vocals, Kate or Cindy provides Quiche\\'s sharp barks.  Given the description of Quiche, whose body is dyed dark green, who is two inches tall with a strawberry blonde ball, sunglasses and a bonnet, and designer jeans with appliques on, I wonder, isn\\'t that dog somewhat overdressed?  Sounds like an SPCA case to me, but at least the song\\'s funny.\"53 Miles West Of Venus\" is another one of their space songs.  The lyrics are very simple--you figure it out.

Come to think of it, everyone could do with a whammy kiss every now and then. Maybe the world\\'ll be a better place, with the positive people featured in the next song, \"Song For A Future Generation.\"This is the most fun song on Whammy. Gushing with positivity, it has girls and boys wanting to gain various titles and uniting for a special purpose. To use an example: \"Wanna be First Lady of Infinity/Wanna be the Nicest Guy on Earth/Let\\'s meet and have a baby now!\" The five group members also have monologues introducing themselves, their signs, and likes. Fred\\'s one is close to mine: \"I like collecting records and exploring the cave of the unknown.\" Small wonder this song\\'s title was used for their first greatest hits album.Where the previous song was very happy, \"Butterbean\" is downright funny and silly, rhythm-wise. It\\'s got a catchy chorus: \"Pick\\'em, hull \\'em, put on the steam/That\\'s how we fix butterbeans.\"\"Trism\" is one of their space age songs. It\\'s about a public transportation device, probably a cross between Transmat and Prism. The girls\\' dreamy chorus \"Go Trism\" adds to the sci-fi imagery of the song, as do the fuzzy synthesizer effects.Gambling is the theme on \"Queen Of Las Vegas\" on a mother who passes her daughter the secrets on how to win at the casinos.\"Moon 83\" is a revamp of \"There\\'s A Moon In The Sky\" from the debut album. A blipping and bleeping synthesizer is the backing music while the words \"This is the space age\" \"others like you\" are repeated.

In that sense, 1984 is the band's biggest album with David Lee Roth, yielding their only #1 single.  It's also the band's last album with David Lee Roth, as he went to pastures new, taking with him their producer, Ted Templeman,--who would return to aid them on Unlawful Carnal Knowledge, but on tracks like &quot;Panama&quot; or &quot;Girl Gone Bad,&quot; Roth's macho swaggering showman vocals are still in prime condition.Listening to the wonder-eliciting futuristic synths and keyboards on the instrumental title track, one couldn't imagine the tensions in the band, but I bet it made their fans wonder what the heck keyboards were doing on a Van Halen album.  Ditto for Eddie Van Halen's opening synths and fuzz characterizing &quot;Jump,&quot; whose keyboards substitute for Eddie's characteristic tapping guitar technique at one point.  It's one of the songs that's a surefire hit, hands down.Things get more rough and ready with the intense and pounding visceral drums and guitar charge of &quot;Panama,&quot; also a single.  The racing car sound effects during DLR's monologue adds to the building up of tension that bursts when they roar back into action.  The 50's/60's-inspired hard rockabilly &quot;Top Jimmy&quot; is lighthearted fun, while the marching-paced &quot;Drop Dead Legs&quot; sounds like a template to &quot;Summer Nights&quot; on 5150, but that's an album away.The sassiest song here is &quot;Hot For Teacher&quot; with a rapid-fire drum solo from Alex leading to Eddie's guitar theatrics matching his brother's tempo.  Listening to DLR's shouted out dialogue, I can imagine him as the class clown in high school, and I can possibly imagine what the teacher did to elicit that &quot;OMIGOD&quot; at the end.&quot;I'll Wait&quot; is one of the mellower tracks.  With the same synths as &quot;Jump,&quot; one can be forgiven for thinking, &quot;Oh man, Van Halen's gone into New Wave synth dross.&quot;  But somehow, it's skillfully done, and it was one of the singles here.  but &quot;Girl Gone Bad&quot; returns to a freight-train pace with the usual guitar theatrics.It's come down to this album and their debut being the best albums, which is ironic given that 1984 is more polished, while maintaining the pulsing metal energy.

Two ballads that give sparkle to this album are the lush and classy \"Noon Rendezvous\" and \"Next Time Wipe The Lipstick Off Your Collar.\"  Quite frankly, I don\\'t know why she didn\\'t maintain this sort of singing in Romance 1600.

Oh, and their revolutionary animated hand-drawn video on MTV made sure my peers heard of them.So, what of the attendant album, Hunting High And Low?  The third single, &quot;Train Of Thought&quot; treads more on an industrial line, though still entrenched in pop, with Harket's non-falsetto voice sounding close to Jim Kerr's but with pop sensibilities.The title track and fourth single is a haunting ballad, where I finally hear Pal Waaktaar's guitars and piano.  Some eagle keening sound effects and soaring synths sound before the drums kick in to make the bridge and final chorus more intense.&quot;The Blue Sky&quot; is harmless pedestrian New Wave pop while the five minute mid-paced ballad &quot;Living A Boy's Adventure Tale&quot; veers more toward Spandau Ballet territory.  There's a nice touch with airy synths and a clarinet (I believe).The second single, &quot;The Sun Always Shines on TV&quot; reached #1 on the UK charts but stalled in the US Top 20.  A Top 5 hit in my book.  The piano-synths, and Harket's falsetto spouting romantic lyrics, lead to an explosion of guitar and keyboards and an intensity that rivals its predecessor single.  The blossoming synths in the chorus must've done it for me.After the brief throwaway ballad &quot;And You Tell Me,&quot; things get back in high gear for &quot;Love Is Reason,&quot; a song Stacey Q wouldn't have minded doing on her first album.  Pal's brief strumming bursts on the chorus is notable on this could've-been-a-single.Could the staccato synths of &quot;I Dream Myself Alive&quot; been one of the paving stones for the Information Society?  Could've been, in the same way the third-gear &quot;Here I Stand And Face The Rain,&quot; with Harket's grimmer lower register vocals might've influenced other industrial groups.How else to follow a successful single like &quot;Take On Me&quot;?  Answer, they couldn't, and they became less relevant to the US and more to the UK, although they later surfaced with the title track to the Bond movie &quot;The Living Daylights.&quot;  No, I don't know what Norwegian for &quot;one-hit wonder&quot; is, and I'd probably be insulting them for trying to find that out.

Diamonds And Pearls may have yielded some radio-friendly singles, but the rest of the album's another matter altogether.&quot;Thunder&quot; shows Prince as still a religious man, and at times reminds me of a stripped down &quot;When Doves Cry,&quot; while &quot;Daddy Pop&quot; has identical instrumentations to &quot;Cream,&quot; but with a more rapid beat than the single, and vocals from Prince and Elisa matching the beat.  One of the better songs here.Add the romantic title track to another prime Prince ballad, with special vocal help from Rosie Gaines, whom Prince respected so much that he vowed never to play this song live with anyone else but her.  Heraldic horns and guitars in the bridge add to the magic.  While stripped down and simple, it's a far cry from sensually lush lovescapes such as &quot;Do Me, Baby,&quot; &quot;International Lover,&quot; and &quot;The Beautiful Ones.&quot;  That honour belongs to &quot;Insatiable,&quot; which has a slow-dancing/bedroom tempo keyboards and percussion and Prince's crooning falsetto.&quot;Cream, sh-boogie bop!&quot;  Measured and paced percussive beats, guitar and organ riffs, and a sound that turns dark coffee into latte, &quot;Cream&quot; stands as a fair single.&quot;Strollin'&quot; is a frisky musical leisure promenade sung in Prince's falsetto, with a simple message of relaxing by playing one-day hookey from responsibilities and gain that sense of feeling swell.The Steeles, whom Prince used on Graffiti Bridge, do a gospel-like power harmonies on the equally frisky &quot;Willing And Able&quot; a song on being confident enough to take risks, with a cards motif equating face cards with what it takes to follow one's dreamPrince still had his overt and aggressive entendres with &quot;Gett Off,&quot; which was probably his most suggestive song since &quot;Darling Nikki,&quot; and experimenting with grinding hip-hop motifs.  &quot;23 positions in a one-night stand?&quot; and &quot;something about a little box with a mirror and a tongue inside&quot;?  A song showing that if a girl's a star, he's the big dipper, and a preview to the simpler but just as explicit single from his next album.The party atmosphere of &quot;Jughead&quot; takes rap a step further than &quot;House Quake&quot; did in Sign O The Times, with Tony M taking a more prominent role than Prince.  On first glance, it seems to be about a dance, but it ends with a slick, Anglo manager delivering some &quot;wheelers and dealers&quot; royalties sales talk to Tony, who after delivering a rant on how managers are parasites who cheat artists out of their deserved royalties, settles the score with a slug.  And it continued with one of the Cavallo-Ruffalo-Fargnoli team suing Prince for defamation.&quot;Money Don't Matter 2 Night&quot; is one of the better songs, a lush and leisure number that weaves losing at a blackjack table, an attempt to find partners for an investment, and killing children to control the oil supply.  The key thing is that one's soul is more important than money.  The musical motifs of this would be revisited in &quot;Sweet Baby&quot; on his Symbol album.&quot;Push&quot; is a song out of LoveSexy that has been given hip-hop arms and legs, rap scratches, and runs the 400 in quality time, with &quot;Glam Slam&quot;-like string synths, and a rap written on the sleeve verso mentioning the first seven songs in a verse.Prince's political consciousness is alive and kicking in &quot;Live 4 Love,&quot; a story of a bomber pilot who after being hit in enemy territory, wonders just what he's fighting for, and makes his decision after coached by his guardian angel, who tells him &quot;live 4 love, without love u don't live.&quot;Whereas the Revolution was an ethnic mix harkening to Sly and the Family Stone, most of the musicians here are black, showing Prince leaning towards a 70's style cultural nationalism stage in his career, and that would be taken to more on his Symbol album.\", 'overall': 4.0, 'summary': 'Back in form, albeit more stripped down and back to roots', 'unixReviewTime': 1079913600, 'reviewTime': '03 22, 2004'}, {'reviewerID': 'A2P49WD75WHAG5', 'asin': 'B000002L9B', 'reviewerName': 'Daniel J.

Prince sings in his falsetto here, accompanied by backing vocals by Wendy and Lisa, who sing, &quot;It's only mountains/there's nothing greater/you and me.&quot;  Fantasy images come into mind with the psychedelic sound.After the slow leisurely stroll of &quot;Do U Lie?&quot; comes &quot;Kiss.&quot;  Now don't get me wrong--&quot;Kiss&quot; is arguably one of Prince's best singles.

In it, the character of Tracy has died.  It's tragic beauty is such that its 6:50 running time is not a debit.  It might as well be a somber postscript to the &quot;Purple Rain&quot; song.  The chorus goes:  &quot;Sometimes it snows in April/sometimes I feel so bad, so bad/sometimes I wish that life was neverending/but all goods they say never last.&quot;Part of what makes this album appealing is its closeness to Around The World In A Day.  The psychedelia from that album has been mixed with the funk of Dirty Mind.

However, this would\\'ve been good as a B-side single from their first two albums.The chorus of \"She Brakes For Rainbows\" sounds like a precursor of \"Deadbeat Club,\" a song from their next album Cosmic Thing.  The song itself is okay, but not great.Not exactly a flattering remembrance to bassist/guitarist Ricky Wilson, who succumbed to AIDS in 1985.

However, this began life as a concept triple album called Camille, before being whittled down to this double release.  I'll just go over selected songs.The title track is basically the news with Prince as its anchor.  He reports on gang warfare, poverty, hurricanes killing people, and the follies of SDI.  He dubs AIDS as that &quot;big disease with a little name&quot;, and the line &quot;It's silly, no?  When a rocket ship explodes and everyone still wants to fly&quot; may be a reference to the Challenger disaster a year earlier.  A sobering and telling lyric:  &quot;Some say man ain't truly happy 'til man truly dies.  Oh why?&quot;&quot;Play In The Sunshine&quot; is very playful, danceable, and jubilant celebration that has the energy of &quot;Delirious&quot; or &quot;Let's Go Crazy&quot;.  Apart from doing the title act, Prince sings: &quot;we wanna be free/without the help of a margarita or ecstasy/We wanna kick like we used 2&quot;  One of my favourites.&quot;Housequake&quot; is Prince's first stab at rap, house, and funk combined and is the name of a dance Prince invented.  The lead vocal is by &quot;Camille&quot;, which may be another alias, like Jamie Starr or Alexander Nevermind, albeit a female one, Prince has picked out for himself.  The voice is slightly like someone inhaling helium.&quot;It&quot; features prominent drums, bass, and a quiet synthesizer and is about him wanting to do it all the time.  Stylings akin to &quot;Automatic&quot; from 1999.&quot;Starfish and Coffee&quot; seems to have missed the Around The World In A Day album.  It's what a dreamy girl named Cynthia has in her lunchbox:  &quot;Starfish and Coffee/Maple syrup and jam/Butterscotch clouds, a tangerine/and a side order of ham&quot;  Kinda sounds like Dr. Seuss.Another standout is the lush slow-dance ballad &quot;Slow Love&quot; is a big improvement over its cousin, &quot;Under The Cherry Moon&quot; and in the same vein, with tones of &quot;International Lover&quot;.  Wendy and Lisa have backing vocals.&quot;U Got The Look&quot;, his well-known duet with Sheena Easton, is easily the most accessible song here, made with Sheila E.'s pounding percussion and Prince's guitar.&quot;If I Was Your Girlfriend&quot; and &quot;Strange Relationship&quot; has Prince in his Camille persona.  The monologue at the end of the singing has Camille confronting her lover on various provocative.  As for the latter, it has a martial pounding drums backed by a funky rhythm.The version of &quot;I Could Never Take The Place Of Your Man&quot; is the unedited 6:31 version.  The catchy rhythm synthesizers and the quickly-sung lines leading to the chorus somehow caught me more than &quot;U Got The Look&quot;.  The way in which he avoids commitment is clever:  &quot;I may be qualified 4 a one night stand/But I could never take the place of your man.&quot;The sombre &quot;The Cross&quot; is another religious tune comforting the downtrodden.  After the second-and-half minute, a slow-grinding guitar picks the pace up, with Prince singing the lyrics at higher intensity.The near 9-minute &quot;It's Gonna Be A Beautiful Night&quot;, sung live in Paris, is another party jam, with vocal help from Susanna Melvoin and Jill Jones, the blonde girl from Purple Rain, and Sheila E. on drums and &quot;Transmississippi rap.&quot;Susanna Melvoin, Wendy's twin sister, has backing vocal duties as well as co-writing &quot;Starfish and Coffee&quot; and despite the breakup of the Revolution, Matt Fink, Wendy, and Lisa do plenty on this album.If any album comes close to being Prince's equivalent of a White Album, this is it.  It's a double CD, has an eclectic mix of music, and was released when he was well established.\", 'overall': 5.0, 'summary': 'Colour me peach and black, and me taken aback', 'unixReviewTime': 1044057600, 'reviewTime': '02 1, 2003'}, {'reviewerID': 'A2P49WD75WHAG5', 'asin': 'B000002LGQ', 'reviewerName': 'Daniel J.

However, I live in such a county and I\\'ve yet to see their solution work.Songs like \"Deadbeat Club\" and the rowdy \"Love Shack\" lets us know that they are hippies at heart, going for skinny dipping or just having a good old time. If they hosted and played at a party in full swing, that would convince me to get my nose out of the books and dance away. Of course, I may need Kate Pierson\\'s personal help in getting rid of my jitters.A wilderness motif is also present in songs like \"Junebug\", \"Bushfire\", and \"Roam\". \"Roam\" encourages the virtue of exploring new places, \"breaking boundaries\", both political and mental.\"Channel Z\" and \"Topaz\", on the other hand demonstrate that their spacey side has not dimmed a bit. The former song projects an activist side of them, as they rail against \"politicrits pushin\\' dope\", waste dumps, toxic fog, and tax dollars funding CIA wars. The solution is: \"Time to open your windows/Let in better weather\".\"Topaz\" and \"Follow Your Bliss\" are my favorite tunes here. The latter is a keyboard instrumental with repeated chords that switch to another set of repeated chords. It\\'s just enchanting!3/5 of this album was produced by Nile Rodgers of Like A Virgin fame, and the rest by Don Was of Was (Not Was) fame.Cosmic Thing is their best album since their debut, enhanced by the rainbow spectrum motif on the album cover.

This one takes a French football radio program\\'s theme music and French commentator Jacques  Bordeux\\'s words before launching into a cover of Neil Young\\'s \"Only Love Can Break Your Heart.\"  I haven\\'t heard the original but I\\'ll say that this version is tempered but upbeat, with piano accompanying the synthesizer beat.  Sarah Cracknell\\'s  waifish vocals is a softer and lightly sugared variation of Susanna Hoffs or Belinda Carlisle\\'s vocals.  The sound is something that Ace of Base would later use in \"All That She Wants.\"That is followed by the drug-looped psychedelia of \"Wilson,\"  a collage of British phrases repeated against a backdrop of slowed down techno-beats.  Phrases such as \"Would you like some sweets, Willie?\" from an elderly aunt-like figure gets mixed up with \"LSD\" to evolve into \"Would you like some LSD?\"  The aunt figure asks Willie \"What would you like then?\"  Willie, a young boy, answers \"Can I have one of these and one of these and two of those please?\"  and also \"Come on auntie, we\\'ll miss the bus!\"  A male announcer calls for \"Mr. and Mrs. J. Summers\" and all these phrases gets repeated over and over.  The effects of Willie\\'s LSD trip, maybe?\"Carnt Sleep\" has a bass backbeat and is a bit more relaxed, like a poppy version of bossa nova.  Sarah\\'s dreamy vocals is different from her opening number and this is the essence of her voice.\"Girl VII\" has a quick-paced beat and some lyrics before Sarah launches into a spoken-word speech on 4 June 1989, which was the date of the Tiannamen Square Massacre, and mentions random places like:  \"Primrose Hill, Staten Island, Chalk Farm, Massif Central, Gospel Oak, Sao Paolo, Boston Manor, Costa Rica, Arnos Grove, San Clemente, Tufnell Park, Gracetown, York Way, Videoton, Clerkenwell, Portobello, Maida Vale, Old Ford, Valencia, Kennington, Galveston, Holland Park, Studamer, Dollis Hill, Fougeres, London Fields, Bratislava, Haggerston, Lavinia, Canonbury, Alice Springs, Tooting Graveney, Baffin Island, Pollard\\'s Hill, Winnepeg, Plumstead Common, Hyderabad, Silvertown, Buffalo.\"  The repeated refrain sounds like \"has been away from\" but is actually \"Carrie has a boyfriend\"\"She\\'s The One\" is about a girl \"who thinks nothing of breaking up two people in love.\" And \"in this world of ups and downs\" to boot.\"Spring\" exalts the time of youth and love, where Sarah tells her young man that he\\'s too young to be through with love after a bad time and that she\\'ll be different.  With the xylophone and string-like \"Theme From A Summer Place\" sound, it\\'s another mellow fresh breeze of a tune.The bass and string-backed \"People Get Real\" features Sarah\\'s vocals done in a haunting echoing effect that\\'s later repeated in other songs here \"Dilworth\\'s Theme.\"There\\'s the instrumental \"Stoned To Say The Least\" which isn\\'t as trippy as \"Wilson\" which has a pounding bass, soon joined by a high-hat, claps, the usual light-techno beats, and an effect reminding me of the sun slowly rising.\"Nothing Can Stop Us Now\" is the other singleworthy song here.  It\\'s upbeat, with some chirpy woodwind-like keyboards here.  However, Sarah has a monologue separate from her haunting vocals, which sing the verse, while her pop voice sings the chorus.\"London Belongs To Me\" is a mellow dreamy song done in Sarah\\'s echoing voice.  The tempo picks up in \"Kiss And Make Up\", which has Sarah doing a mea culpa on saying hasty things she didn\\'t mean and to well, \"let\\'s kiss and make up.\"  Another good dance club number.  And \"Like The Swallow\" begins with a wall-of-sound instrumental before the song starts about a girl who is \"like the swallow that flies so high.  She\\'s like the river that never runs dry.\"  The slow closing ditty of \"Dilworth\\'s Theme\" mirrors what listeners who enjoyed this album might say to Sarah:  \"Oh babe, I know you\\'ve gone./I won\\'t be sad alone /\\'cause the song that you left me/has the sweetest refrain.\"90\\'s alternapop is the way I\\'d categorize Saint Etienne\\'s early oeuvre, and coming as it did in 1991, they were ahead of their time.  Foxbase Alpha is also the first of three \"conventional\" albums before SE launched into their hybrid ambient-pop beginning with Good Humour in the late 1990\\'s and continuing today.

That\\'s the good stuff referred to.  He even tells the girl \"The big dipper sure ain\\'t big enough/To hold all of your dang good stuff.\"\"Is That You Mo-Dean?\" is a quirky story about a guy who gets kidnapped by a UFO and is returned to earth 987 years later, by which times all his friends have died.\"The Earth\\'s Green Laughter\" is a cool instrumental with jungle sounds, mostly birds, woodpeckers, thunder, native South Americans, and rain falling infused within, and could be another in their pro-environmental songs like \"Juicy Jungle.\"  Another wordless wonder in the tradition of \"Follow Your Bliss.\"The mid-paced \"Breezin\\'\" with Fred and Katie, is another one of their positive affirming songs.

The sound of the soundtrack itself threw me for awhile, but I wondered why it had been put in the cut-out bins only two years after its release.  It was clear that Prince was still in some kind of transition period that had begun with LoveSexy, been interrupted by the superlative Batman soundtrack, and would end with Diamonds And Pearls.  Many of the songs are retreads of his previous oeuvre.The energy of &quot;Can't Stop This Feelin' I Got&quot; is a great way to start the soundtrack.  It could be a cousin of &quot;Let's Go Crazy,&quot; except its missing those fiery Hendrix riffs.With &quot;N.P.G.&quot;, we have the introduction of the band that would be billed on his next album Diamonds and Pearls.  With a heavy funk beat, and a call for a revolution and against the imposed old rules, and the calling for others to join them on the dance floor.  There's still the peace and love motif, but it's activist.  Other guests include Rosie Gaines, to get more fame on the title track to Prince's next album, Morris Day on drums here, and sampling by Levi Seacer, who would collaborate more with Prince later.  Part II of this song concludes the album, reminding the listener that a new era is about to begin.The Time get four songs here, of which the first &quot;Release It&quot; starts out with some of Morris Day's rapid-fire talk, then a sax bit by Candy Dulfer.  It also has the steady rollicking drums that would pop up on Diamonds And Pearls and (Symbol).  Nothing like the Time's debut or Ice Cream Castle, but it does have Day's primping man-about-town-with-the ladies schtick that has Jerome hunting down Stellas for him:  &quot;I'm not a man.  Jerome?/He's an adventure/Slap me.&quot;  Dulfer gets some chance to do some nice blowing here in this dance jam.  The mid-paced funk of &quot;Love Machine&quot; has Elisa on lead vocals, Morris doing his raps, and Candy back on sax.  The best number is &quot;Shake,&quot; with some insistent guitar riffs and keyboard motifs that would pop up in Prince's &quot;Cream.&quot;  Finally, the Time and Prince team up in funking &quot;The Latest Fashion,&quot; which resurrects the line &quot;What time is it?&quot; the line &quot;oak tree,&quot; which was from Day's first solo album, and Morris's squawking laugh in the beginning.  Dulfer again appears in sax support.The slow-bumping ballad &quot;The Question Of U&quot; is one of the highlights of this album, recalling &quot;Under The Cherry Moon.&quot;  &quot;Elephants And Flowers&quot; fits in the Sign O The Times era with its tight funky beat and instrumentation.  And at least Prince is telling the truth when he and George Clinton duet on &quot;We Can Funk.&quot;&quot;Thieves In The Temple&quot; became the only big hit here, and the temple here is one's soul or self-esteem, with the thieves being negative feelings and thoughts.  Although not bad, I would've chosen some other number as a single.Mavis Staples' bluesy-soul-dance of &quot;Melody Cool&quot;, backed by the Steeles, is decent enough to offset some unspectacular filler earlier.  The Steeles back Prince in the piano and synth ballad &quot;Still Would Stand All Time,&quot; which is one of the standout cuts here.It's clear that with the title track, Graffiti Bridge is the same as Paisley Park, some place of happiness, whether it's &quot;a reason to believe that there's a heaven above&quot; or &quot;everybody's looking for love,&quot; or a place where &quot;everybody wants to find the perfect one/someone that makes you happy/someone who makes you laugh when you want to cry.&quot;  This multivocal harmony sung by Prince, Mavis Staples, Tevin Campbell, with backing vocals by Levi Seacer Jr. and Sheila E., and an orchestra, is definitely the best song here.Compared to Purple Rain, Graffiti Bridge is more a soundtrack as despite being billed as a Prince album, it contains songs by other artists, most of whom outshine Prince, particularly the Time.  Taken by itself, it's ok, but within the entire Prince canon, ranks as one of his weaker albums.\", 'overall': 3.0, 'summary': \"One of Prince's weake albums, redeemed by some goodies\", 'unixReviewTime': 1077926400, 'reviewTime': '02 28, 2004'}, {'reviewerID': 'A2P49WD75WHAG5', 'asin': 'B000002MNF', 'reviewerName': 'Daniel J.

Well, yes!This collection aptly gathers the multitude of hits accumulated by the Purple One from 1978 up till 1992, when his [Symbol] album heralded a change in things to come, such as his name from 1993 to 2000.  This was also Prince at his most potent.In glancing through, one can tell by the number of singles per album which was considered his weakest--Parade, LoveSexy, and Graffiti Bridge boast only one song.  Albums like Dirty Mind, 1999, Purple Rain, and Sign \\'O\\' The Times are thought to be the notable peaks in the Prince mountain range.  Around The World In A Day would definitely be the most colourful.  The importance of Dirty Mind is brought to light here with the number of songs from it included here.  Not one of his best sellers, but it did define Prince as an artist in his own right instead of being a second-rate Stevie Wonder.This collection is an asset in several ways.  One, it has the single edit of songs like \"1999,\" \"When Doves Cry,\" \"I Could Never Take The Place Of Your Man,\" \"Controversy,\" and \"I Wanna Be Your Lover.\"  Mix tape makers, rejoice!

The dual dynamics of life are explored in the piano and strings ballad \"The Color of Roses\"  \"Life gives us magic/and life brings us tragedy/everyone suffers some loss/still we have some faith in it\"\"Beyond The Blue\" which includes some excerpts from the Paramahansa Yogananda Cosmic Chants demonstrates her gentle but soaring vocals, which has a gentle substance like Carole King or Karla Bonoff, but smoother.  \"This life is but a dream/go gently down the stream...\" seems to have a Taoist element in there.The stresses of everyday burning away \"All The Time In The World\" is a mid-paced light country rocker.  \"These precious days we live through/thrown away like tissue/I wish I could give you all the time in the world\" she sings.  And she further sings she would dodge cops, jump ditches, and drive eighty miles an hour just to do that.The title track is just as tearful as \"The Color of Roses\" as it shows how we are forced to do some things \"all alone\", such as trying to find meaning amid the pain, in Chapman\\'s case, this meaning her loss and how she will have to raise their son by herself.  \"All alone I came into this world/all alone I will someday die/solid stone is just sand and water, baby/sand and water, and a million years gone by\" goes the chorus.  Chapman got a shot in the arm when Elton John heard this and began performing it live.\"Fair Enough\" veers more light guitar jazz than the country rock or melodic ballads.  \"Seven Shades Of Blue\" is an intimate folk song featuring Michael McDonald as a guest vocalist.  A very tactile song at one point, where she describes the rain like \"little knives upon our tongues.\"\"Happy Girl\" is a more upbeat number about the transformation going from \"a face of stone and a heart of gloom\", \"standing in a corner wearing concrete shoes\" to \"roll[ing] my heart out like a welcome mat.\"  The harmonica, mandolin, and bandoleon give this a more folky tinge, kind of like Mellencamp during his Lonesome Jubilee days.\"No One Knows But You\" is another piano ballad, where she sings about feeling her lost one\\'s presence.  The bridge totally shows her devotion:  \"And if there is some magic/some way around these stars/.../I\\'ll cry this empty canyon/an ocean full of tears.\"Bonnie Raitt shows up as guest vocalist for \"Heads Up For The Wrecking Ball\" a song about keeping oneself solid in the mean old world, and to do the title thing.  Slide dulcimers, accordions, and dobros give this a slight folky tinge.\"Say Goodnight\", as opposed to saying goodbye, is another coping mechanism for loss.  Another tearful piano and strings ballad that closes the album, although there is a brief instrumental of \"The Color Of Roses\" that\\'s on the same track.A few tissues for the more soft-hearted is recommended on songs like the title track, \"The Color of Roses\" and \"Say Goodnight.\"  This is a very personal album and Chapman finds an effective way to cope with her loss.

This is the same song that seems to be played in the book American Psycho, not the movie.&quot;World Without You&quot; is a nice ballad whose styling reminds me a bit of John Waite's &quot;Missing You&quot;.  The same rhythm guitar and synthesizer styling permeates throughout the next song, &quot;I Get Weak&quot;, which is not a weak song by any means; she makes it credible, thanks to lyrics by ace songwriter Diane Warren.The fun-tastic fast-paced &quot;Fool For Love&quot; has a simple and sweet chorus:  &quot;If I'm a fool for love (3x), I don't care (2x)&quot;&quot;Nobody Owns Me&quot; has a strong pounding rock guitar dominant.  It also makes Belinda one of the few singers who has the license for singing &quot;oooh&quot; to finish a line AND make it sexy.  Susanna Hoffs is the only other one I can think of who also qualifies.The sad and wistful &quot;Love Never Dies&quot; closes the album.Rick Nowels produced this album, as well as Runaway Horses and Live Your Life Be Free, and no doubt his masterful skill contributed Belinda's well-deserved stardom.  Add to this are some talented guest singers and artists, including Charlotte Caffey, and two-thirds of what would later become Wilson Phillips, as well as Mellencamp drummer Kenny Aronoff.Heaven On Earth lives up to its title and for me, this was one of the best reasons to be alive in 1987.  Every song here is singleworthy, and there are very very few albums to which I can say that to.\", 'overall': 5.0, 'summary': 'Heaven Is A Place On Earth?

Although I don\\'t see the resemblance between her and the cartoon character of the same name, Pebbles yielded a few albums before going more into management.  Pebbles though did better on the R&B; and dance charts.The first I\\'d heard of her was her contribution on the Beverly Hills Cop 2 soundtrack, the funk dance of \"Love/Hate,\" which was produced by Andre Cymone, who\\'d done splendid work for Jody Watley\\'s first album.  This could\\'ve easily fit on Watley\\'s album.\"Girlfriend\" though was her first Top 40 hit, reaching #5.  A typical piece of soul-dance with a pulsing funky bass and string orchestration, it\\'s not bad, but an unlikely song to reach its position.  The version of \"Mercedes Boy\" here is not the heavily redone radio mix.  Why is it I prefer the original versions to the radio ones in all songs?  Pebbles\\' highest charting pop singles hit, reaching #2.  Nice enough song with a smooth beat, but again, an unlikely song to get so high.Two other songs I was keen on other than the singles were the back-to-back Jets-like \"First Step (In The Right Direction)\" a reasonably upbeat number, and the swinging horn and synth tune \"Take Your Time.\"\"Do Me Right\" is a more relaxed mid-paced number with the usual funky synths and a host of nice backing vocals.  \"Baby Love\" is along the same line, but the closing song \"Give Me Your Love\" is a nice lush synth ballad that could\\'ve been a single.Pebbles got a lot of help on her debut, including the Sembello brothers, Babyface, Andre Cymone, and the man whom she married, Bam Bam, sorry, I mean, L.A.

The result was Power, which was more suited to the 80's sound prevalent then, with more in common to Journey and Survivor's style rather than the days of &quot;Dust In The Wind&quot; or &quot;Point of No Return.&quot;The first single, &quot;All I Wanted&quot; was comparable to a mid-tempo Journey yearning love song laced with keyboards and pop sensibilities.  It made the charts and the video led to a brief second wind.However, songs like the racing &quot;Silhouettes In Disguise,&quot; featuring riveting guitarwork shows Kansas still a force to be reckoned with, despite the semblance to Journey.The title track and one of the singles tells how power can be used for self-affirmation and liberation instead of fortune and pride.  Survivor could have fun with this song.Orchestra warmups are heard in the beginning of &quot;Secret Service.&quot;  The steady drumbeat, pulsing bass, and multiple backing vocals make this more a Foreigner-type song, a cousin to &quot;Jukebox Hero.&quot;  And there is some orchestra work used here.A Boston-like guitar opens and his heard throughout &quot;We're Not Alone Anymore&quot; and there is a slight throwback to their earlier sound.  &quot;Musicatto&quot; is an insistent instrumental drums and keyboard fills heralding the art-rock feel of the 1970's and the three serious thematic songs that follow.  &quot;Taking In The View&quot; is an acoustic number about how the young embody progress, different POVs, and push the envelope of generation.  &quot;Three Pretenders&quot; is more harder-edged with Survivor riffs.  Childhood skepticism, personal integrity, and the call to adventure are what the protagonist is fighting to keep against the title characters.  And &quot;Tomb 19&quot; is about the treasure-filled tomb of a Mayan king and the curse that await those who try to rob it has a Sodom and Gomorrah-like motif:  &quot;take the treasures of Tomb 19 but never look behind you.&quot;The final song and second single, &quot;Can't Cry Anymore,&quot; is a Survivor-type ballad with synth fills that grow in power with each chorus repeat.  One of my favourite tracks.A laudable work from a 70's group trying for a second wind in the synth-oriented 80's.

A different sound, more pure rock and blues,... were these really the same women who did the raging \"If Looks Could Kill\"?A fiery bluesy guitar opens on one of their all-time classics.  \"Magic Man\" is about a girl who\\'s spellbound with a man of her dreams, to the chagrin of her mother.  That pulsing bass keeping rhythm works to advantage on this bluesy rock number.  Ann and Nancy\\'s choir-like vocals highlight the second part of the song, after the pause.  Then that pulsing guitar that rises until Ann starts singing the chorus again:  \"But try to understand/Try to understand/Try try try to understand/I\\'m a magic man.\"  Aw yeah!Then comes version 1 of 3 of the title track, this one the short Fantasy Child version, which opens with ocean waves, a gentle acoustic guitar, and Ann proving she can do a quiet ballad as well as rock out.This then segues into their second great single, which should\\'ve risen higher than the Top 40--\"Crazy On You.\"  It dwells on the safety of having one\\'s partner throughout the madness of a chaos and trouble-torn world, \"bombs and the devils\", and personal \"the kids keep coming.\"  It\\'s quicker than \"Magic Man\" and between the two, I favour this tune.  It is alternately poignant, \"Wild man\\'s world is crying in pain/What you gonna do when everyone is insane/So afraid of wanting, so afraid of you/What you gonna do....?\" and beautifully lyrical at the same time:  \"My love is the evening breeze touching your skin/The gentle sweet singing of leaves in the wind/The whisper that calls, after you in the night/And kisses your ear in the early light\" and \"I was a willow last night in my dream/I bent down over a clear running stream/I sang you the song that I heard up above/And you keep me alive with your sweet, flowing love.\"  Wonderful stuff!For the most part, \"Soul Of The Sea\" is another lush guitar ballad with string arrangements about casting one\\'s sorrowful past after meeting that someone.  \"Time, time, time, time/Never ask what\\'s become of us/Just dedicate your sorrow/Here and now/To the soul of the sea/And me.\"  The bridge then turns into the disillusioning daily drudgery a female worker has to deal with, complete with typewriter keys clacking in one section.  After Ann belts out \"No silence\", the tempo returns to the lush romantic tempo of before.Then comes the title track, whose tempo is a light canter, but it\\'s at least longer than its predecessor version.\"White Lightning & Wine\" is another mid-paced bluesy-rock number and is about the effects the title drink has on a woman\\'s perception of a bar pickup--a variation on someone not gifted in the looks department looking pretty after a few too many.  A woman\\'s gonna have to drink a gallon of that stuff before she takes a shine to me, I\\'ll tell you.Acoustic ballad time with \"(Love Me Like Music) I\\'ll Be Your Song\" and seeing as Ann\\'s a singer/musician, comparing her to a song is appropriate.  Ann and Nancy sing together in the second verse, and the effects are angelic.  Their harmonies and the following lyric really prove the Wilsons to be the bad angels of rock ballads.The rocker \"Sing Child\" sounds a lot like early Zeppelin, and some of Ann\\'s vocal phrasings resemble Robert Plant\\'s.Sweet ballad time with \"How Deep It Goes,\" and the piano and violin make this one of my favourites.  The flute solo after the second verse is a sweet touch.  The following line makes me wonder if the whole thing is a reference to Vietnam:  \"If I could leave anymore, even though there\\'s a scar/Still fresh from the war, don\\'t think about it no more/Letting new love flow.\"The reprise version of the title track is slow in the same vein as the Fantasy Child version, and the piano makes this nicer, but after the flute solo, it goes into lush strings, highlighted by kettle drums.  The imagery of the opening lyrics is stunning:  \"Heading out this morning into the sun/Riding on the diamond waves, little darlin\\' one.\" and the portrait of a dreamer is aptly put in the line,  \"Going down the city sidewalk alone in the crowd/No one knows the lonely one whose head\\'s in the clouds.\"  Alone in the crowd, lonely one, head in the clouds... oh, that\\'s me!A brilliant debut and one of the best albums of the 1970\\'s.', 'overall': 5.0, 'summary': \"Try to understand--he's a magic man!\", 'unixReviewTime': 1054512000, 'reviewTime': '06 2, 2003'}, {'reviewerID': 'A2P49WD75WHAG5', 'asin': 'B000002UE9', 'reviewerName': 'Daniel J.

So what\\'s the big deal about a scraggly haired demonic green-eyed woman  with a long tongue sticking out?  Apparently a lot to the censorship folks.  The edited album cover was a narrow strip that merely showed the eyes and orange slightly below and above.  Fortunately, I manged to snag the unedited cover.\"Love On The Rocks\" recalls Motley Crue and Cinderella, only not as hard as those two groups, but a good enough dose of rock and roll and swaggering bedroom antics.  Another track Diamond Dave would be proud of.\"Nothin\\' But A Good Time\" was a good choice for the first single although not as rowdy as the first single from their debut.  The theme of blowing one\\'s hard-earned money for a good time to compensate for an unsatisfying job is shown clearly here.  The part before the final chorus run-through is a favorite.  After CC\\'s solo, comes the rhythmic thumping of the drums in measured time.Going \"Back To The Rocking Horse\" seems like a good idea to me.  After a brief been-there, done-that explanation, the narrator longs not only for a simpler time but to start all over again.  Gosh, the things I\\'d do if I had the chance, and the world had better look out!  A worthy rocker.A bluesy harmonica and beats owing nods to to \"Sweet Emotion\" and \"Walk This Way\" is displayed on \"Good Love,\" which is to the girl of the song what petrol is to a car.  The lifestyle led by the couple in this leads neighbours saying \"the things you\\'re doing ain\\'t natural, boy.\"The naughtiest and hardest rocking non-single track here is \"Look But You Can\\'t Touch\" about his trying to seduce a young thing who later doesn\\'t seem quite as innocent as all that.  When he sings \"I didn\\'t plan on spending money just to get a piece of mind\", he emphasizes the word \"mind\", making me think, \"Yeah, as opposed to something rhyming with mass.\"  The guitar squeals in time when he sings that he gets slapped in face for making an illegal move.\"Fallen Angel\", the second single, is about a small-town girl whose dreams of show business includes a life in the fast lane, \"rolling the dice of her life.\"A heartfelt sigh opens the heartbreaking \"Every Rose Has Its Thorn\", their first #1 song and a mature ballad looking back at a blown chance to make or break a relationship.  After words like \"like the knife that cuts you/the wound heals, but the scar, that scar remains,\" I thought, \"And these guys did \\'Talk Dirty To Me\\' two years ago?\"  This really set the standard for their other great ballad, Flesh & Blood\\'s \"Something To Believe In\"Then comes a cover of Loggins and Messina\\'s \"Your Mama Don\\'t Dance,\" which is good old fashioned rock and roll from the 70\\'s.  By the time this single came out, hard on the heels of the previous one, the album had run its course, hence its failing to make the Top Ten.Things get slower, the sound lacking the ferocity of Look What The Cat Dragged In, which results in a few filler tracks, compensated for by \"Every Rose...\" but Bret Michael\\'s swaggering bad-boy, play all night with beautiful women tone, is still here.

When I hear some lyrics, &quot;As I pull the sheet back on the bed, I want to go bury my head in your pillow&quot;, and &quot;Now that I'm all alone again/I can't stop breaking down again/The simplest things set me off again&quot;, I eerily think of Linda McCartney's death died 9 years after this song.The trials of life in a marriage are recounted in &quot;We Got Married&quot; whose sound is a distant cousin to &quot;Things We Said Today.&quot;  Dave Gilmour's trademark guitar crunches along as if to affirm the gladness of being together despite hardships.  A lyrical triumph, especially this:  &quot;I love the things that happen/When we start to discover who we are/And what we're living for/Just because love was all we ever wanted/It was all we ever had.&quot;  Marriage, says Macca at the end, &quot;It's not just a loving machine/It doesn't work out/If you don't work at it.&quot;One of the standout cuts is the bouncy, sweet acoustic &quot;Put It There&quot; of a tender assurance from a father to son that he's there to help him:  &quot;If there's a fight, I'd like to fix it/I hate to see things go so wrong&quot;  It's reminiscent of &quot;Blackbird&quot;, except sweeter, with string orchestration by George Martin.&quot;Don't Be Careless Love&quot; is a poignant portrait of a worried man waiting the late hours for his girl, worried she got killed by some mugger, until he goes to bed.  In the end, he finds her back in bed, and it's all right&quot;Figure Of Eight&quot; is something to avoid ending up in.  It's an affirmation of loving instead of hating and taking care of one another.  An 8 is the infinity symbol on end, but infinity could mean an endless loop one can't get out of.The upbeat electric guitar number &quot;This One&quot; reveals the downside of waiting for the perfect moment such as being open or affectionate.  It's an explanation, an apology, that I found convincing.The elegiac ballad &quot;That Day Is Done&quot; is of someone who's died and is sung from that person's point of view, with references to a woman in higher circles who's spurned him.  I've felt this way during my dark moments:  &quot;That day is done, that day is done/You know where I've gone/I won't be coming back/That day is done.&quot;The relaxing reggae-ish beat of &quot;How Many People&quot; is dedicated to environmentalist and Brazilian rain forest advocate Chico Mendes, who was murdered in 1988.  This song answers questions philosophers and poets have asked for many ages.  &quot;How many people have died?&quot;  &quot;How many people never make it through to the other side&quot;, &quot;How many people have cried?&quot;  It's like his own &quot;Blowin' In The Wind.&quot;&quot;Motor Of Love&quot; is a very languid cousin of &quot;My Love&quot;.  It's ironic that given his closing remarks in &quot;We Got Married&quot;, he sings here &quot;I don't anything from you/Turn on your motor of love.&quot;  Uh, what about the loving machine?&quot;Ou Est Le Soleil&quot; is French for &quot;where is the sun?&quot;  Accompanied by a backbeat of a programmed drum machine and various instruments, the lyrics go &quot;Ou est le soleil/dans la tete/Travaillez&quot;, meaning &quot;Where is the sun/In your head/Go work&quot;While McCartney writes most of the songs solo, he gets co-writing help from a certain DeClan McManus, a.k.a. Elvis Costello, who does harmony vocals on &quot;You Want Her Too&quot;.  The sound, while spright, is more mid-paced, far from the rock theatrics of &quot;Band On The Run&quot; or &quot;Jet&quot;.

What You Don't Know is the Miami-based girl trio's second go-around with producer Lewis A. Martinee, who also does many different instruments on many of the tracks.

The girls harmony vocals is also used to great effect.The horn-enhanced title track contains the same bouncy energy backed with intense percussion and drum-machines that &quot;Come Go With Me&quot; and &quot;Point Of No Return&quot;.  The Jets wouldn't be out of place doing this, and tracks like this would've saved their career.  The &quot;In Effect Mix&quot; of this song, with rap-scratching effects and enhanced bass, give it an early Janet Jackson flavour.The pace continues when Ann sings on &quot;Stop, Listen, Look &amp; Think&quot; which could also have done wonders for Brenda K. Starr.The string-like keyboards opening the Paula Abdul-ish &quot;Tell Me Why&quot; hint at a more serious message, that of the effects of senseless crime:  &quot;Tell me anybody why can't we live together/end all the fighting erase it all forever/listen to this reason before it gets too late/soon there will be no one, no one left to hate.&quot;  The pre-chorus refrain is sung in unison by the trio to great effect.The nocturnal slow dance R&amp;B number &quot;When I Looked At Him&quot; demonstrates why Jeanette does best as the balladeer and singer.  Message here:  &quot;It's not a dream/we all need love and understanding/we must break thru/and make a love that's everlasting.&quot;  Added piano, strings-keyboard decorate the more lush &quot;Suave Mix&quot;, also on this album.&quot;Let Me Down Easy&quot;, which mirrors the same instrumentation as the title track, is also sung by Gioia, and could've been a good Jets or Cover Girls number.Songwriters Billy Steinberg and Tom Kelly give &quot;Still Hung Up On You&quot;, which could give Bananarama a run for its money in bubble-gum style music.  Gioia on vocals here.Then ballad number two with Jeanette, written by Diane Warren (oh yes!) and its a heartbreaker.  The impending collapse of a relationship is central to &quot;Your Baby Never Looked Good In Blue.&quot;Ann sings &quot;Now that I Found You&quot;, whose bounce is lightweight compared to the first three songs, but is decent enough, as it segues into the similarly tempoed &quot;Love Don't Hurt (Until You Fall), backed by string-synths and brass, and sung by Gioia.If you thought the previous Jeanette ballad was a heartbreaker, &quot;Didn't It Hurt To Hurt Me&quot; goes even further in emotion.  Gioia lacks the suppleness of Jeanette but does wonders here in a world that's unexpectedly turned upside down.  The string-keyboards help the atmosphere, as does the bridge:  &quot;When I think of all the pain/the pain that was left to subside/but now I think it's too late for you to cry.&quot;  An awesome number.The brass-enhanced &quot;Walk Along With Me&quot; gets back to the quick tempo of the first three songs and is a perfect way to end the album, not counting the remixes.  All three take turns on lead vocals.  When they sing &quot;Walk along with me/change all the feelings/sing along with me, shape the world&quot; I'll accept that invitation gladly, for the following reason.I went to see Expose in concert in 1990 while they were promoting this album, and it's the best concert I've ever been--in fact, when the girls, generosity booming in their hearts, asked those of us to come on up to get closer to them, I rushed forward from Row 7 and got to the penultimate row, almost shaking hands with Gioia!  A night to remember!What really helps is that the individual song credits list the lead singer.  Jeanette comes off as the best vocalist.  Wonder why she never went for a solo career--I would've sprung for an album of hers.  This was Gioia's last album with the trio, as she left to have a family.

One was that producer Lewis Martinee produced only a third of their eponymous album.  Other producers were brought in to bring a new sound, emphasizing bouncy-ball drum machines, high-pitched synths, harmony choruses, and songs by Diane Warren, meaning better ballad, which worked.  Two, Gioia Bruno was replaced by Kelly Moneymaker.  Three, Ann Curless began to share more vocal duties than she did in the previous two albums.From the thumping drum machines and string synths of &quot;I Think I'm In Trouble&quot; hints at the new sound, like a cross between The Cover Girls and Stacey Q.  There's also a great use of harmony vocals in the chorus.The Martinee-produced &quot;You Don't Know What You Got&quot; tries to incorporate conga, What You Don't Know-like material, and even rips the funky guitar sound from the &quot;Theme To Shaft&quot;.&quot;I Wish The Phone Would Ring&quot; goes into 80's R&amp;B territory, material owing a nod to Paula Abdul's Forever Your Girl album.  There's nothing more frustrating than having a fight and wishing the other would ring first, is there?Then, three lush ballads in a row-a real treat!  The soulful and inspirational &quot;As Long As I Can Dream&quot; is the best of the three and my favourite Expose song ever, having that trademark Clive Davis sound, laden with sad strings and piano-like synths.  The theme of a world &quot;that's too hard to take and everything's in blue&quot; is familiar enough, but as Ann sings, &quot;when the rain's pouring down, and I can't find the sun doesn't mean the sun can't be found/it always comes through.&quot;  And love that chorus:  &quot;As long as I can dream/there's a better world (2x)/there's a better world/I see it shining/in my dreams I see/there's a better world (2x)/as long as I can dream.&quot; Oh, and Diane Warren wrote this song, so no surprise why it's so good.&quot;In Walked Love&quot; sounds at home on Wilson Phillips' first CD, especially with the cheery harmony vocals.  &quot;Just when I thought I'd give up/out walked loneliness/in walked you/in walked all my dreams a-coming true.&quot;  Aww, how nice!The third is the single, &quot;I'll Never Get Over You Getting Over Me.&quot;  How I remember those lines, &quot;As long as the stars shine down from the heavens/long as the rivers run to the sea&quot; and then the title.  I'd heard this over and over when I was at Las Cruces on the radio, but never the artist name.  That changed only three years ago, when my store manager put me wise.  I was bewildered!  Expose did that too?  Whoa!&quot;Angel&quot; mimics a Shep Pettibone-like freeze-dried techno sound while &quot;Face To Face&quot; produced by Martinee is an okay throwback to their earlier sound.  The DNA-produced &quot;I Specialize In Love&quot; comes next.  This good-natured tune invites those with broken hearts, needing a happy ending, basically those with many quarts down on love to come on down.  &quot;I'll make you feel like new/let me work on you.&quot;  The part where they trade vocals on what they can do is also a nice touch.&quot;Touch And Go&quot; leans towards early Janet Jackson-type funk, think &quot;What Have You Done For Me Lately?&quot;, backed by the Martinee horns, although with the trio's harmony vocals, Janet could do this, but I'd still be thinking of Ann, Jeanette, and Kelly.&quot;The Same Love&quot; is another Diane Warren song.  What a treat!  This Air Supply-like ballad, complete with strings, explores the dual nature of love:  &quot;Sunny days have left me standing in the rain, somebody tell me/how can the same love that made me so happy/make me so sad, I don't understand/how could the same eyes that used to be laughing cry in the night, it doesn't seem right at all.&quot;With the rap-style scratching of the harmony vocal in &quot;love&quot;, some early techno comes through in &quot;Give Me All Your Love&quot;.  The rest of the song is a more developed version of something from the Exposure album.More polished, varied in style, and featuring four wonderful Diane Warren songs, Expose's swansong is a worthy followup to What You Don't Know.

A very Buddhist outlook on life is shown when she sings \"now everyone one of us was made to suffer/everyone of us was made to weep.\"A slow but steady drum machine sets the tempo for \"Precious\", punctuated by bass and airy synths, rejoicing on the arrival of a special one who\\'s a breath of fresh air after being \"covered up with sadness\" and being cynical and twisted all the years.

With lines as \"I\\'ve shed my tears in bitter drops until the thorn trees bloomed/to take the spiky fruit to crown myself the Queen of doom\", this is obviously not a happy song.\"Cold\" features the same airy synths and pianos as \"Why,\" a languid tempo, and Annie\\'s gospel-like soul backing vocals.  Cold is what Annie wants to feel less of lest she be frozen over due to a lack of reciprocated love.  The line that really struck me was \"Dying is easy, it\\'s living that scares me to death.\"In \"Money Can\\'t Buy It\", Annie sings against materialism and to drive that point home, does a rap where she briefly takes on the persona of a rich white girl whose got so many diamonds she can\\'t close her safe, showing how this girl is \"lying awake in a sick dream.\"  Instead, she sings \"I believe in the power of creation\" and \"in love alone.\"The closest to a Eurythmics song here is \"Little Bird\", with its insistent tempo and keyboards.  Shown here is the contrast between a free, flying bird in the sky with a troubled soul weighted to the ground, feeling \"so dark with rage and fear\" and wanting the strength to emulate that bird.\"Primitive\" is another melodic synth ballad on hopes and prayers to make on strong during the brief life in the ephemeral world.\"The Gift\" has Annie at her most desolate, giving a tired disillusioned face on a stifling relationship, and the need to stop \"living in this same sick joke.\"The final song \"Keep Young And Beautiful\" is a send-up of an upbeat 1920\\'s-style piano ditty extolling the virtues of cuteness and looks and figure for the good life, and never mind about brains.  It even sports scratches from an old LP for effect.More melodic and wistful than anything Eurythmics has done, Diva shows Annie Lennox as a capable solo artist, though a few more uptempo songs could\\'ve helped.', 'overall': 4.0, 'summary': 'First solo album is more laid back, bittersweet affair', 'unixReviewTime': 1071100800, 'reviewTime': '12 11, 2003'}, {'reviewerID': 'A2P49WD75WHAG5', 'asin': 'B000002VMJ', 'reviewerName': 'Daniel J.

Further good news:  there are more ballads for Taylor's voice to exercise emotional lung power, which she does better on this album.The first evidence of Taylor's new sound comes from the Pettibone--produced and co-written &quot;I'll Wait&quot;, which features held down wall of sound organ-synth a la Pet Shop Boys in some parts, while the funky bass and soul flavour pepper the chorus.  Her voice has gone beyond her previous effort, Can't Fight Fate.A ballad so early?  Great!  &quot;Send Me A Lover&quot;, produced by Humberto Gatica.  This is a medium-intensity power ballad, with a sound similar to Aerosmith's &quot;What It Takes&quot;, though not as raucous.Her cover of the recently-departed Barry White's &quot;Can't Get Enough Of Your Love&quot; is a retread, duplicating the classic disco of the original, which may explain why it stalled in the Top 40, but her husky voice does the song justice.The mid-paced &quot;Dance With A Stranger&quot; is a cross between Berlin's &quot;Take My Breath Away&quot;, mimicking the synthesizer, with rhythmic bits from Kim Carnes &quot;Bette Davis Eyes.&quot;&quot;I Could Be Good For You&quot; was penned by Diane Warren, where given the innate loving characterShep Pettibone puts his 80's disco flavour on &quot;Say A Prayer&quot; and the title track.  Honestly, it's Taylor's potent voice and some above average synth arrangements that puts this head over another Shep Pettibone-produced album, Madonna's impersonal and freeze-dried Erotica.&quot;The Door To Your Heart&quot; is the other Diane Warren song and it gives Keith Washington another heartfelt ballad, the first being his collaboration with Kylie Minogue in &quot;If You Were With Me Now.&quot;&quot;Someone Like You&quot; is typical dance filler going through the motions, but that's followed by &quot;Memories&quot;, a great soul ballad enhanced by a gospelish backing vocals from Taylor and Lotti Golden.  The closing ballad &quot;If You Were Mine&quot; was produced by Narada Michael Walden, and giving her Whitney Houston-type gospelish sound does her justice.  Her voice rings out the best here.A shift from total reliance from one producer, two great Diane Warren songs, more soulful ballads, and a classic disco cover really helps Taylor Dayne outdo her previous release, Can't Fight Fate.  Lyrically, nothing memorable, the usual love cliches, but they are enhanced by Taylor's improved voice.  A pity this album wasn't highly regarded.

With string-synths and other keyboards slightly reminiscent of Eurythmics, \"Ready Or Not\" seem to drown out the girls\\' harmonies in this mid-paced dance number.With a weird swirling keyboards opening, followed by a sax, the drum-machine backed ballad \"Trick Of The Night\" was the Rams\\' third single here on the night life, focusing on a lady\\'s man who has a different life.  \"but the wind comes through you try to sell your soul/everyway you go it\\'s a long way/now you\\'re no longer just the boy next door/when they were falling in love with that clean cut smart change of style/just for a lttle while.\"  When I first heard it, I questioned its validity as a single.  Now, I think it\\'s one of their best.\"Dance With A Stranger\" is another low-key delight that missing link between light Brit-pop and samba or easy jazz, what with the piano, vibes and percussion.  The lush string synths kick in during the chorus:  \"before we kiss the world goodbye (it\\'s only a breath away)/one more dance before you die (so tender as the music plays)/there\\'s no emotion only passion in your cry/love is the last thing on your mind when you dance with a stranger.\"  And this verse vividly adds to this portrait of loneliness on a dance floor. \"the spinning room the cold caress/I try to hide my loneliness/cheek to cheek we let the evening drift by/the hollow mask has disappeared/we drown our love through salty tears/the state of night is like a racing car/ I now see you for what you really are.\"  The sax solo that comes in really adds to the jazz flavour of this standout cut.The spoken word intro spells out the grim tone of the low-key dance song \"Love is easy. No complications, in a perfect world\"  However, the cold hopelessness of the world make sit far from perfect:  \"His heart is willing/but the world\\'s so cold/oh, how he longs for someone real to hold.\"  The Rams have it down when they sing \"All we need is understanding/love is easy/maybe tomorrow we\\'ll try again (no complications)/in a perfect world.\"With their infectious cover of The Shocking Blue\\'s \"Venus\", the Rams dip their toes in the Stock-Aitken-Waterman ocean they would be swimming in with their Wow album.  A deservedly #1 hit in the US, with the jangly guitar, bopping drum machine, and Mike Stock\\'s keyboards.  This is the most danceable hit for the Rams, until equally body-slammers such as \"Love In The First Degree\" and \"I Want You Back\" from Wow, came along.\"Do Not Disturb\" is nice danceable fun about a weekend for two spent alone that turns cloudy when the girl turns up alone.  Could\\'ve been a single.  \"A Cut Above The Rest\" is slowed filler, while \"Promised Land\" is passable dance fare.The second Stock-Aitken-Waterman song here, \"More Than Physical\" flopped Stateside, but this second single wasn\\'t all that bad even though it\\'s a comedown compared to \"Venus.\"The sermonizing anti-drug \"Hooked On Love\" features rapped verses and sung choruses.  From a twelve-year old sucking on butane gas to a girl found in a pool of blood, the Rams say there\\'s a better drug.The trio would sign on with S-A-W for their next album (Exit Swain and Jolley) which would yield seven singles, including two that became dance chart 12\" mixes.

With his gritty soulful pipes, and soul music accompanied by a brass section and a strong rhythm section on those foot-stomping numbers, his brief impact on the music scene hinted at things to come had he not died aged 26.The slow-dance of \"I\\'ve Been Lovin\\' You Too Long\" is simply heartwarming, nice for the last dance of the evening.  His first Top 40 hit reached #21.Redding describes \"Respect\" as a song taken away from him by a certain girl.  While his version charted at #35 on the pop charts and #4 on the R&B;, that certain girl, a Ms. Aretha Franklin, took it to #1 for two weeks (pop) and four times that long on the R&B; charts.  But Otis\\'s original still has that original stomping rhythm in it.  Ditto for \"I Can\\'t Turn You Loose,\" a #11 R&B; hit that deserved better on the pop charts.  Small wonder the Chamber Bros. covered it the year after he died.  And \"Mr. Pitiful,\" which barely missed the Top 40, has a shaking funky rhythm that would presage early 70\\'s style soul.Though a #6 hit for Ted Lewis in 1933, Otis Redding\\'s version of the tender \"Try A Little Tenderness\" made it to #25, (R&B; #4), higher than the other covers of the rock & roll era, though Three Dog Night came close with it in 1969 at #29.  Rod Stewart did his hand of it on his Out of Order album.He and Carla Thomas duet and rap with each other in \"Tramp,\" where she gives him a hard time about his clothing and haircut, about how he\\'s too country and not cosmopolitan.  But he\\'s okay with it, and holds his own.  There is a brief horn melody that the Beatles later used or may have used in the \"Hey la hey la hello-a\" section that closes \"Hello Goodbye.\"His performance at the Monterey Pop Festival (June 1967) was considered to be one of the highlights, as Michelle Phillips, one of MPF\\'s prime organizers, saw Otis as THE reason she wanted the festival in the first place.  He performed a cover of the Stones\\' \"Satisfaction,\" which had reached #31 a year prior.  His version featured a brass arrangements, making his version an interesting contrast to the original.  He also did a rousing cover of Sam Cooke\\'s \"Shake\" and reached out successfully to the flower power crowd.  Seeing the footage of him at Monterey doing this song made me want to get his music.It was thus unbelievable that he only had six months left to live after Monterey.  He then recorded a song quite different from his usual oeuvre.  Three days later, he and four members of the Bar-Kays died in a plane crash on 10 December 1967.  The track, the brooding and reflective \"Sitting On The Dock of the Bay,\" became his only #1 pop hit, three months after he recorded it, and staying there for four weeks, also spending three weeks atop the R&B; charts.  Countless others, including the Dells, Sammy Hagar, and notorious R&B; song shredder Michael Bolton have covered it, but Otis\\'s version remains the most respected and brightest.  I first heard this in Top Gun, when Tom Cruise explains to Kelly McGillis how it was his mother\\'s favourite song.Of his other posthumous singles, \"The Happy Song\" reached #25, and is a return to his usual style, while \"I\\'ve Got Dreams To Remember\" featuring a nice female backing chorus, fits in with his slow songs a la \"I\\'ve Been Loving You Too Long\" and \"Try A Little Tenderness.\"What would Reddings\\' career have been like had he survived?  His success at Monterey hinted at bigger things, definitive crossover potential, though among the R&B; pantheon, he still would\\'ve faced stiff competition from Motown artists like the Supremes, Marvin Gaye, and the Temptations.

With a lineup that included Joao Gilberto on guitar and vocals, Antonio Carlos Jobim on piano, Tommy Williams on bass, Milton Banana on drums, and on the two most memorable songs, Joao\\'s wife Astrud.  However, the driving force behind this was tenor saxophonist Stan Getz, and his straight-tone, controlled-vibrato sound.The album starts appropriately enough with the Grammy winner for best song, \"The Girl From Ipanema\".  This is the full 5:22 version that begins with Joao Gilberto singing in Portuguese.  Then comes that soft voice and those familiar lyrics:  \"Tall and tan and young and lonely/The girl from Ipanema goes walking/And when she passes/Each one she passes goes haaa.\"  Well, the thing that makes me go \"haaa\" here is Astrud Gilberto\\'s voice.  Getz\\'s sax solo and Jobim\\'s piano in the middle serves as a bridge between the two refrains.  There is a 45 rpm version of this classic, the 2:46 single edit of just Astrud singing, included later.  I must confess that I first heard a parody of this song, Bob River\\'s \"The Girl With Emphysema\", and then sought hard to find out the original version, which led me to this album.\"Corcovado (Quiet Nights of Quiet Stars)\" is the other song featuring Astrud Gilberto.  In the full 4:14 version, we have Joao doing Portuguese lyrics, as he did in the full version of \"Ipanema.\"  There is a dreamy quality about this song, particularly when Astrud sings \"Quiet nights and quiet dreams/Quiet walks by quiet streams/And the window lookin\\' on the mountains and the sea how lovely.\"  And Getz\\'s sax really enhances that exoticness as does Jobim\\'s piano.  BTW, Corcovado is the name of a mountain overlooking Rio de Janeiro.  There is a 2:21 45 rpm issue included here as well.As for the rest of the songs, Getz\\'s rich saxophone provides the rich qualities that make this a winner, particularly his solo on \"So Danso Samba\" with its \"vai vai vai vai vai\" refrain by Joao Gilberto.  The song title means \"I Only Dance Samba\", as opposed to calypso, the twist, and the cha-cha that were sweeping the country\\'s dance floors in the 1960\\'s.

In order to replicate the order of the songs as done in the movie, program tracks 2-13, 1, then 14 in that order.  There, it's Beatles songs, solo/Wings, Beatles, and then both versions of &quot;Lonely Nights.&quot;The medley of &quot;Yesterday&quot;, &quot;Here, There And Everywhere&quot; and &quot;Wanderlust&quot; is my favorite here.  All the songs seem to fit cohesively, despite coming from different albums--Help!, Revolver, and Paul's solo album Tug Of War.  The end of &quot;Wanderlust&quot; has a refrain melody back to the second song, with Ringo's crashing drums bringing it back to the ending chords of &quot;Wanderlust.&quot;  The brass ensemble brings back memories of the past.The presence of &quot;Ballroom Dancing&quot;, also from Tug Of War, and &quot;Silly Love Songs&quot;, both upbeat, are a welcome inclusion to the soundtrack.Then there is what I call the rock set, &quot;Not Such A Bad Boy&quot;, &quot;So Bad&quot;, and &quot;No Values&quot;.  The first and last song are rockers compared to the pop heard before, with &quot;So Bad&quot; from Pipes Of Peace sandwiched inbetween.&quot;Eleanor Rigby&quot; leads to &quot;Eleanor's Dream,&quot; a seven minute string quartet/orchestral extrapolation from the original song.  It's best seen in context of the scene in the movie, of the picnic gone wrong, treachery and comeuppance of Harry in the imaginary sequence.My second favorite track is &quot;The Long And Winding Road,&quot; done without the excessive Phil Spector wall of sound in the original Let It Be version.

I enjoy everything on this compilation, even his own take on Cyndi Lauper\\'s \"True Colors\".Phil Collins had some hit singles from movies, and their inclusion in a greatest hits are a lifesaver for the fan. \"Against All Odds\", the eponymous movie hit, \"Groovy Kind Of Love\" and \"Two Hearts\" from Buster, and \"Separate Lives\", his sparkling, bittersweet duet with Marilyn Martin from White Nights, are present here. The presence of \"Against All Odds\" alone will more than likely spur the purchase of this compilation.Another gem is his duet with Phil Bailey, \"Easy Lover\", a real catchy dance tune, where Phil Bailey\\'s falsetto is a real contrast to Collins\\' vocal. That song, \"Against All Odds\", and \"Separate Lives\" is what prompted me to buy this album, by the way.I kind of lost track of Collins in the 90\\'s during my college days, when I got turned on to college and alternative stuff, but \"I Wish It Would Rain Down\" is a prime example of the kind of ballads that have placed him in pop\\'s history books.

The backing harmonies, piano, and especially that brass ensemble make for an upbeat pop number that made it to the Top Ten.  His producer George Martin does electric piano and old bandmate Ringo does drums.  My third favourite song here.&quot;Somebody Who Cares&quot; is a sweet ballad sympathizing with someone who's lonely.  He likens it to &quot;somebody who has taken the wheels of your car/when you had somewhere to go&quot; but he injects a note of hope, that &quot;there's always someone, somewhere/you should know by now/always somebody who cares.&quot;Stevie Wonder's familiar funky synthesizer sets the backbeat for the first Wonder/McCartney duet, &quot;What's That You're Doing.&quot;  While it's a catchy engaging number I like, it's more at home on a Stevie Wonder album.&quot;Here Today&quot; is a &quot;I Will&quot;-type ballad, enhanced with a string quartet as in &quot;Yesterday.&quot;However, two songs from here were reprised in the Give My Regards To Broadstreet movie two years later.  The first is the engaging rocker &quot;Ballroom Dancing&quot;, a nostalgic look at one's childhood, of &quot;sailing down the Nile in a China cup&quot; and fighting with a girl &quot;like cats and dogs/till we made it up in the ballroom.&quot;  Watching ballroom dancing on TV was what made a man of him.  The electric guitar and piano really highlight this rowdy number to make it the standout.The grim &quot;The Pound Is Sinking&quot; is a combination currency market report that reflects the mood of the spoiled girl of the song.  He says it's not his fault that the market's sinking and why should it spoil their relationship.  A sharp jab is given when he says she hasn't inherited his father's mannerisms.My second favourite song is the ballad &quot;Wanderlust&quot;, the other song done in Broadstreet.  Wanderlust seems to be the name of a ship that the guy misses, despite it being his ticket to be free from a relationship.  The Philip Jones Brass Ensemble really does a great job throughout.&quot;Get It&quot; is a nice ditty, a duet between Paul and Carl Perkins, with the title referring to fame in the music biz.After a weird link involving Paul's voice through a vocoder, things get down and dirty with &quot;Dress Me Like A Robber&quot;, which has a disco overtones with the funky guitars and keyboards and Paul's falsetto, but sans the string synths.Finally, there's the hit duet between him and Stevie Wonder, &quot;Ebony And Ivory&quot; about liv[ing] together in perfect harmony&quot; racially.  I wonder if the militant black-nationalism of the late 1980's to early 1990's have relegated this song to idealistic schmaltz.  The message is still relevant, although today's people know how to hide their prejudices better.This album sees Paul teamed up with George Martin, who produced the Beatles early albums and now, Tug Of War, and the cohesiveness of the album really shows his masterfulness.  What I also notice is how versatile McCartney is, playing three to five instruments per song, be it bass, piano, acoustic guitar, synths, percussion, and drums.

In one inspiring part, Belinda sings how \"[I] used to hunt for darkness/and it would follow me/wherever I\\'d go/now I\\'m looking up again/I got no more time for feeling low.\"The last two songs, \"I\\'m With You\" and \"Mercenary\" are slower, but still have a strong sound permeating throughout the rest of the album.After Talk Show, first Jane Wiedlin, replaced by Paula Brown, then Belinda Carlisle left the fold, and the Go-Go\\'s were no more until God Bless The Go-Go\\'s in 2000.  What\\'s important is that each member of the band did their own thing.  Belinda Carlisle had the best solo career of the lot, followed by Jane Wiedlin who also did some acting.

The ensuing album enabled Gordon to showcase her own voice, which has the wistfulness of Aimee Mann mostly clear of the dual harmonies done with her bandmate Louise Post.  Some songs have an aftertaste of Salt, but others prove Gordon to be a credible solo artist, having fought the seether, and with a sound that does not, as some anti-VS people jeered, &quot;sounds like the Breeders.&quot;  Gordon has transcended into more personal introspective songs that make her an alternative Carly Simon or Aimee Mann.&quot;Now I Can Die&quot; is a mid-paced euphoric paean to that special and perfect someone who has finally made her levitate, with uses of the words &quot;sweetheart&quot; and &quot;turtledove&quot; as verbs.  So complete is she fulfilled that if she won't feel sad or bad if she dies tomorrow.  The ringing guitars, distinct Aimee Mann meets Juliana Hatfield vocals and steady drums characterize Gordon's new sound.That feeling of personal fulfillment is carried on in the dreamy and happy-kind of sad title track of the weightless, breathless, and enough when she sings that &quot;the universe is resting in my arms.&quot;  These two songs alone bring out a Gordon unfettered from the salt chains.The regret of missing out on someone and &quot;getting used to the aftertaste&quot; is given in &quot;Too Slow To Ride.&quot;  And &quot;2003&quot; is the year she promises to meet someone when she's ready.Songs like &quot;Badway&quot; and &quot;Got Me Down&quot; shows Gordon with one foot still in the salt.  The former has the heavy distorted crunch evident in Veruca's Eight Arms album and a sound that sounds like &quot;Seether&quot; coated with thundering aural Black Sabbath guitar by Gordon and producer Bob Rock.  Telling lyric:  &quot;When I'm this low, I'm like a self-made hand grenade but I can't pill the pin.&quot;  The former has a more wistful tone though bearing the same aural buzz in the chorus.  &quot;New Year's Eve&quot; on coming to a party wearing heartache on one's sleeve though it's not in vogue is also halfway in the salt.On VS's debut album, there was a song called &quot;Number One Blind.&quot;  Well, &quot;Number One Camera&quot; is another upbeat Salty song with roaring guitars on remembering an affair, and she could construct a camera to record various scents.How many people feel out of place, like &quot;Horses in The City&quot;?  That's what she exudes in this introspective song, where her solo vocals in the verses wondering about the horses passing her window, alternate with aural Salt/Sabbath attacks in the chorus.  At the end, she wonders if the horses will run free without reins again.&quot;Hold On To Me&quot; is another slow Mann-like song that'd fit on Whatever, made wistful by the airy Mellotron and her soaring vocals.  One of the better songs here.The final song is a superior cover of Skeeter Davis's &quot;End Of The World&quot; whose melancholy is carried through by the string-like mellotron, Gordon's melodic voice.  It's the agonizing question of why life and nature goes its happy way when one's feeling emotional angst: &quot;don't they know, it's the end of world/it ended when we said goodbye.&quot;And the fact that I reserved and bought Gordon's album on the release date and totally ignored Veruca's Resolver album shows whose flag I've raised.  With the right promotion, Nina could well have a promising career.

I in fact got this after hearing \"Dead Leaves\" and the fact that it was named album of the year in one magazine.  That award is indeed justified.  With the third album, the Whites, set in their monothematic red and white.A steady churning, snarling guitar sets the pace of \"Dead Leaves And The Dirty Ground,\" punctuated by The Led Zep chords pounded out near inbetween verses.Then comes the quick-paced and quick-sung bluesy-country \"Hotel Yorba.\"  \"Well it\\'s 1-2-3-4 take the elevator/At the Hotel Yorba/I\\'ll be glad to see you later.\"  Engaging to say the least.\"I\\'m Finding It Hard To Be A Gentleman\" has some of the same rhythms as \"Dirty Leaves\" except there\\'s piano accompaniment and none of the hard guitars.  Old-fashioned gentlemanly courtesy is explored here, with a humorous closing verse:  \"Well I never said I wouldn\\'t throw my jacket in the mud for you/but my father gave it to me so/maybe I should carry you/then you said \\'you almost dropped me.\\'/so then I did and I got mud on my shoes.\"  And nothing else?  Wow!Then comes the quick Elastica-style, punk-adrenalized \"Fell In Love With A Girl\", and what a girl!  Even though she has a guy, she says \"come and kiss me by the riverside/Bobby says it\\'s fine he don\\'t consider it cheating.\"\"Expecting\" is another heavy-chord, early L7/Led Zeppelin stomp.  The lyrics seem indecipherables, but I detected sexual overtones in the song.The brief throwback to 50\\'s rock, \"Little Room\" features only Jack on vocals while Meg pounds her pagan skins, demonstrating how sometimes, simplicity works.  This clocks in at 50 seconds.\"The Union Forever\" seems to be a conflict between a rich girl into \"oil mines, shipping, or real estate\" while the guy is with the union.  It\\'s a slow number but the guitars roar to a fury with the agonized lyrics \"cause it can\\'t be love.\"  Mid-song Jack raps out a bit of a rant while Meg clicks her drumsticks. together.\"The Same Boy You\\'ve Always Known\" is a softer refined version of \"Dead Leaves.\"  Then comes my favourite song here.  \"We\\'re Going To Be Friends\" is a sweet, idyllic acoustic elementary school ditty of a boy and girl.  Think of the Beatles\\' \"Blackbird\" or Paul McCartney\\'s \"Put It There.\"  I\\'d bought this album after hearing \"Dead Leaves\" but I really began listening to this in earnest after hearing this song.  Child-like hope and innocence is reflected in the closing verse:  \"Tonight I\\'ll dream while I\\'m in bed/when silly thoughts go through my hand/about the bugs and alphabet/and when I wake up tomorrow I\\'ll bet/that you and I will walk together again.\"The rhythm of \"Offend In Every Way\" is Hendrix-like.  The conflict of humility and self-affirmation is evident, because \"no matter what I do/offend in every way.\"The angry \"I Think I Smell A Rat\" has a fierce snarling surf guitar reminding me of Shadowy Men Of A Shadowy Planet at its hardest moments.  The guitar slows down at one point, distorted like a record whose RPM is slowly going down.\"Aluminum\" has Jack doing some Robert Plant-like vocal warmups before the Led Zep/Hendrix guitar riffs pound out in a blaring tone while Meg crash boom bangs in the background.\"I Can\\'t Wait\" is an accusation at a manipulative girl who leaves when things don\\'t go well for her, only to come crawling back.  The narrator wishes \"this house felt like a home.\"\"This Protector\" features a pounded piano and both Whites singing.  A mixture of punk, slow grunge riffs, hard surf guitar, blues, 50\\'s rock, the Whites are very eclectic on this breakthrough album.  On naming this album White Blood Cells, well, like the same leucocytes that protect our body\\'s immune system, this album is ample protection against the pap churned out today.

Their alterna-dance sound, inspired by early Pet Shop Boys but with a twist of Etienne added, is more coherent and innovative.  Songs that are alternately cheery but with sober and sad ones done with Sarah Cracknell\\'s dreamy sugary vocals prevent this from being Foxbase Beta.  Oh yes, between the songs are samples of old British movies and random bits of dialogue from who knows.  What really gets me cranked is that they didn\\'t list which movies they took them from-I would\\'ve gone looking for them.  My favourite one is \"Memo to Pricey,\" where a girl asks, \"You think a girl should go to bed with a fellow if she doesn\\'t love him.\"  To which the guy responds.  \"No.  Unless it\\'s me.\"Anyway, enough of that.  \"Mario\\'s Caf&eacute;\" has a smooth, refreshingly mellow portrait of the title caf&eacute; and the customers in it.  A violin-like synthesizer plays with the lyrics:  \"When we meet for a while /Tuesday morning 10 AM\"  It seems like a laid back place.After that is \"Railway Jam\", which begins with a British movie sample, then continues as an instrumental, with echoing sounds of a train going down a tunnel.  The rest of it reminds me of a train slowly making its way in daylight, with scenes from the countryside.  The rhythmic drum machine is punctuated occasionally by guitar.In \"Calico,\" Q-Tee raps babyishly with Sarah singing \"Calico\" in her haunting Lulu-like voice.  A bass underlines the constant drum machine.The haunting and sadly introspective \"Avenue\" puts Sarah\\'s vocal talents to good use and its 7:35 length doesn\\'t seem noticeable.  I get the feeling she\\'s riding on a slow train, looking out the window, then letting her mind wander to the sad past, longing for a Maurice.  Inbetween verses, she sings \"Oo-oo-ooh/young heart.\"After another dialogue 40\\'s movie sample, \"You\\'re In A Bad Way\" explodes in a bubbly burst of refreshing pop.  Sarah tells of a guy who\\'s down because a bad day-burnt toast, bills in the mail, dull TV, rain.  Her prescription:  \"Just dial my number/I\\'ve got some plans for you/You\\'re in a bad way/and I can help you through/You\\'re in a bad way/ every day is just the same/Just dial my number/or call my name.\"Then comes the best song, the very slow and tearjerking \"Hobart Paving\" which always puts me in a reflective funk every time I hear it, especially the keyboard solo in the middle.  It\\'s a combination conversation between a separated couple and on the man\\'s new woman.  On herself, she says:  \"Rain falls/like Elvis tears./Oh no/no sugar tonight. /Out on the high street/dim all the lights and/Cry coloured tears again.\"  The title seems to be a train platform, as she says, \"Hobart paving, don\\'t you think that\\'s it\\'s time?/The ticket\\'s in my hand, the train pulls down the line.\"  If anyone needs evidence of Saint Etienne\\'s talent or Sarah Cracknell\\'s voice, look no further than this song.\"Leafhound\" sounds like a song from Foxbase Alpha that could\\'ve helped that album, with its soft jangling guitar accompanying the drum machine.  Another introspective driving down the highway song.A familiar burst of hard rock guitar, a sample of Rush\\'s \"The Spirit Of Radio,\" cuts in with the upbeat techno-dance number \"Conchita Martinez.\" The only lyrics are \"Conchita, I know/ I know it should have been.\" Not to worry, she won Wimbledon the year after.The dreamy, lazy \"No Rainbows For Me\" deserves the spoken outro sample:  \"Yes, well, that one didn\\'t sound too furious.\"  \"You think my heart\\'s a toy/ like a little boy /You pick it up/and play with it/and break it when you\\'re through.\"The morgue in the dreamy soundscape \"Junk The Morgue\" is the polluted planet Earth and Sarah calls for us to leave the planet for somewhere else:  \"You can look at the stars/look at the ocean/The answer\\'s somewhere/here\\'s what i reckon /Close your eyes/kiss the future/junk the morgue.\"The joyful techno of \"Join The Club\" ends the album and with this album, I\\'d be glad to.

The latter is clearly the most talented of the trio.  Alt-rock/pop with the steady drum machines is the best way to classify her music, and with catchy hooks and rhythms, different in each song within a consistent sound.  Branch also writes or co-writes most of the songs on The Spirit Room, her debut album.There is the tendency to look back to Alanis Morissette as the template of today\\'s young music femmes-e.g. Kelly Clarkson\\'s \"Since You\\'ve Been Gone.\"  \"Everywhere\" features that toned down guitar roar washover.  Similar walls of sound are prevalent throughout otherweise mid-paced songs like \"Something To Sleep To\" with the protagonist being the genuine emotional support as opposed to the other woman who leads the male down the \"yellow brick road\" and \"as far as she lets him go.\"  A similar theme is found in \"If Only She Knew,\" only this time, the protagonists are separated though the woman still loves the man, whose feelings are stifled, yet want to come out.  The title refers to if the other woman knew just how the exes feel about each other deep inside.The concept of having someone, a soul mate, who understands what one feels inside, is behind the mid-paced \"You Get Me.\"  The protagonist is portrayed as different, with Uri Geller metaphors:  \"so I just bend their spoon\" to describe the discomfort the normal people feel.  The glory of finding that soulmate is given in the refrain:  \"Hey, you are on my side.  And they, they just roll their eyes.\"The single \"All You Wanted\" ratchets the thoughtful quietude of Lisa Loeb\\'s \"Stay\" with some slower Veruca Salt-type rock, maybe a little of what Nina Gordon did on Tonight And The Rest of My Life.  Clearly a standout here, with \"So lonely inside/so busy out there/and all you wanted was somebody who cared\" being a byline for so many of us.The feeling of liberation thanks to someone else\\'s wings is in \"You Set Me Free\" has some catchy hooks and soaring vocals in the chorus that again reflect girlish Nina Gordon-type vocals.  A similar sound was later used in \"Breathe\" in Hotel Paper.\"Here With Me\" is your basic come-back-to-me song.  The relationship must\\'ve been strong, as the catchy rhyming couplet \"I died just a little, and I feel it now\" and \"I believe that I would cry just a little\" attest to.  Mid-paced and heartfelt.  Saying farewell is hard as seen in the third single, the sad \"Goodbye To You,\" especially one where one realizes the last however many years, three in the case of the song, was just a sham.The dynamics of opposites is seen in \"Sweet Misery,\" where the man was strong, optimistic, seeing the beauty in everything and where the woman was weaker and lost, with the title being what the woman was called by the man.There is also a starry-eyed yet spiritual quality in Branch\\'s songs.  That is shown in \"Drop In The Ocean\" with its quiet organ-like keyboards, accompanied by string-like synths, and the usual drum programming, amid which Branch\\'s dreamy voice wafts towards a high note, with the refrain of feeling small like \"a drop in the ocean\" but \"feeling heaven\\'s skies in your eyes.\"  The drum machines then go uptempo, accompanied by her soaring vocals.  Other than the singles, the best song here.Given today\\'s charts way-tilted in favour of rap, Branch\\'s singles haven\\'t done too badly, \"Everywhere\" reaching #12, \"All You Wanted\" at #6, and \"Goodbye To You\" at #21.  Now ten years ago, these numbers would\\'ve been better.There\\'s a tightly constant and consistent sound and decent songwriting that bolsters this promising debut from Branch.

And &quot;Let The Good Times Roll&quot; with its layered backing vocals was another defining sound with the Cars.Judging a group solely by the number of Top Forty or Top Ten hits isn't always a good barometer.  The Cars didn't have many during their decade-long career, and only four of those hit the Top Ten.  And it took till their fourth album, Shake It Up, to do so.  The first one of those was &quot;Shake It Up&quot;, whose pulsing racing synths and upbeat drums, and Ocasek's quirky voice, which to me is the epitomy of the Cars sound.&quot;You Might Think&quot; with its pulsing keyboards, rhythm guitar, and heavy guitar, is my second favourite song, and a more produced sound is apparent here without sacrificing the usual Cars sound.  I remember this from the video where Ric Ocasek turned into a flying insect.  This came from their Heartbeat City, their masterpiece album produced by Mutt Lange.  Also from there is my favourite Cars song, their highest charting one, the haunting and sombre Ben Orr-sung ballad &quot;Drive&quot; which got to #3 on the charts abetted by its multiple atmospheric synths.  The girl in this song seems in need of a reality check or a fast lifestyle with that refrain &quot;you can't go on thinking nothing's wrong/who's gonna drive you home tonight?&quot;  The verses consist of questions to this girl:  &quot;who's gonna pay attention to your dreams/who's gonna plug your ears when you scream?&quot;  A similar feel was later attained in Orr's solo single hit &quot;Stay The Night.&quot;The #7 &quot;Tonight She Comes&quot; was their fourth and last Top Ten single.  The new song from their Greatest Hits, it was just as quick-tempoed as &quot;You Might Think&quot; with a cool guitar solo by Easton, but by 1985, the arrival of new groups and the novelty of New Wave was dying down.With the exception of &quot;Drive&quot;, they didn't seem to have much luck on their moodier songs such as &quot;Since You're Gone&quot; or the keyboard-oriented &quot;I'm Not The One.&quot;Of the other three singles from Heartbeat City, &quot;Magic&quot; scores great with its opening space-age sounds and the hard guitars even though the tempo's a bit slower than &quot;You Might Think.&quot;  &quot;Hello Again&quot; is good, but its #20 showing denoted that the album was selling more, and was &quot;oversingled&quot; by the time &quot;Why Can't I Have You&quot; was released.As for their last Top Forty hit, &quot;You Are The Girl&quot;, it was more of the same but more polished and programmed.  The song itself is more musing and romantic, and lyrical, &quot;why don't you flash that smile like you used to do?&quot; and &quot;You are the girl in my dreams&quot;, and I'm partial to it due to the crazy sci-fi/planet of alien women video it spawned.A more budget-priced and hence hit-efficient compilation compared to the sprawling Just What I Needed anthology, Complete Greatest Hits has the essentials in one disc, with peak positions and release dates for the albums and singles included.\", 'overall': 4.0, 'summary': 'A more hit-efficient collection of the Cars', 'unixReviewTime': 1074988800, 'reviewTime': '01 25, 2004'}, {'reviewerID': 'A2P49WD75WHAG5', 'asin': 'B00005YW4H', 'reviewerName': 'Daniel J.

Sit back and let the evening go.The daughter that sitar virtuoso Ravi Shankar ignored proves that she can make it on her own.  The fourteen songs on her debut album Come Away With Me are a melodic fusion of jazz, blues, and folk (in that order) and easily at home on the CD changer along with Shawn Colvin, Sade, and other such artists.Smoky, gentle, smooth, and warm--that's how I describe her voice.  I find it hard to compare her voice to anyone else, so that shows how special she is.  In a song punctuated by her piano, such as the title ballad, a mixture of slow jazz with tinges of country, her voice is the star.  Whether accompanied by piano or acoustic guitar, she succeeds in not being overdominated by the instruments and comes full front, singing, wrapping the melodies of the instruments around her.&quot;Seven Years,&quot; a sweet number featuring Norah, an acoustic guitar, and a sitar-sounding National guitar, is my favorite song here.  It's a tender portrait of a seven-year old girl, who's &quot;Spinning, laughing, dancing to her favorite song/A little girl with nothing wrong/And she's all alone.&quot;Second place goes to the title track, which is the perfect example of her eclectic mix.  It's also a nice romantic song of going away with someone somewhere, whether it be a mountaintop or a field with knee-high yellow grass.Other noteworthy songs:  she gives a nice bluesy-jazz flavor to Hank Williams' &quot;Cold Cold Heart.&quot;  &quot;Feelin' The Same Way&quot; is the least slow song here, but that's because of the slightly quicker tempo of the drums.  &quot;Turn Me On&quot; is another jazz-country ballad that I can't picture any country singers covering without messing it up with their shrill voices.  &quot;Painter Song&quot; is classic cafe midnight jazz staple.  Ditto for &quot;One Flight Down,&quot; with its &quot;Now you know&quot; refrain.

Hamlow', 'helpful': [14, 23], 'reviewText': \"Having listened to Norah Jones' Feels Like Home, I now see that the Pete Malick CD was more than just a stopgap release for this long-awaited jewel, but more of what she could do.  While some of the songs have the same relaxing inflection and instruments as Come Away From Me, Norah introduces styles ranging from blues, folk, and even bluegrass.  And the presence of other instruments, such as strings, electric guitar, and Hammond organ shows her styling evolving.  Cute publishing name for her songs--Muthajones Music.The pronounced rhythm section of slit drums and acoustic guitar on &quot;Sunrise&quot; make it a track that wouldn't make it on Come Away With Me.The bluesy/country-ish  &quot;What Am I To You?&quot; with its electric guitar and Wurlizter electric piano is a throwback to her music with Pete Malick.  Here she asks in the chorus:  &quot;I'll love you when you're blue/but tell me darlin' true/what am I to you?&quot;&quot;Those Sweet Words&quot; starts out with that melodic piano, backing drums and soft vocals in the same light jazz manner as &quot;Feelin' The Same Way&quot; from her debut.  Ditto for &quot;Carnival Town,&quot; which also sports a cello and viola.  The use of the carnival as an analogy for life is interesting, how one looks down as the ferris wheel reaches its apex, or the brief laugh a clown gives one, i.e. it's lonely at the top, and life goes on after the thrill of a brief moment is gone.  When Norah asks &quot;Is it lonely?/lonely/lonely&quot; in the chorus, I can sense a silent &quot;yes&quot; being answered within.&quot;In The Morning&quot; is kind of uptempo jazz/folk number about the aftermath of an affair, with these clever lines:  &quot;Funny how my favourite shirt/smells more like you than me.&quot;  That Wurlitzer piano playing indeed reminds me of mellow 70's music.The analogy of a swift current to life and the fish as everyone else who seems with it is shown in the introspective &quot;Toes.&quot;  The first verse I can relate to:  &quot;The current is strong from what I've heard/it'll whisk you down the stream/but I never seem to have the tune/so my toes just touch the water.&quot;  Lyrically, one of my favourites here.The humility felt by a single mother who's broken down on the road and is forced to call her ex, who's now making something of his life and has another woman, is in the sobering &quot;Humble Me&quot;, which features only a pump organ, a prominent resonator guitar, and bass.  The protagonist's feeling guilty in this song.The feeling of hesitancy in rejoining the world, meeting a special someone is felt in the slow and bluesy &quot;Above Ground&quot; of a woman living underground, with nothing but her thoughts and a ceiling fan above her.  The promise is that &quot;I'll be with you someday&quot;, but when?She does two covers here, Townes Van Zandt's &quot;Be Here To Love Me&quot; and Tom Waits' &quot;The Long Way Home.&quot;  There's a folky/country feel to it, but the bulk of it Norah accompanied by the bass and the tapping on a box, making it a nice minimalist number.Norah tackles an upbeat folky/bluegrass number, &quot;Creepin' In&quot; which features Dolly Parton as guest vocalist.  There's an interesting double meaning here.  Verse one goes &quot;There's a big hole/that's gone right through the sole.&quot;  Hence the water goes creepin' in.  Well, in the final chorus, instead of going &quot;and once it has begun/won't stop until it's done&quot; it goes &quot;and once you have begun/don't stop until you're done.&quot;  It's almost as if she sang in the repeat of the first verse &quot;that's gone right through my soul&quot; instead of &quot;my sole.&quot;  Clever, that.The last two numbers could belong on Come Away With Me, the daydreamy country/jazz &quot;The Prettiest Thing&quot; and melodic 40's piano jazz of &quot;Don't Miss You At All&quot;, which includes portions of Duke Ellington's &quot;Melancholia.&quot;  This is quite a melancholy and reflective piece, of watching falling snow and thinking the title.  One of my favourites here.Topping a masterpiece like Come Away With Me would be next to impossible, but lo and behold, Muthajones has incorporated other styles in her light and mellow jazz inflections.

The CD  is a quiet and lush alternative to ninety-percent of the popular music on  the market today, and also a welcome substitute for the often hectic pace  of daily life. Enya's arrangement of the compositions on Memory is well  thought - the comparatively dramatic and uplifting `Anywhere Is' and `On My  Way Home' are placed so that the listener doesn't fall asleep.However,  I'm very leery when I read a dozen reviews of a particular musical release,  and all the writers rate the artist's work with five-stars. My hesitation  is not a matter of taste (listeners are free to condemn or rave about  whatever they please), but one of perspective. Is The Memory Of Trees a  musical ground breaking effort? Does it introduce a unique technique or  significantly alter a current genre of popular music? On close listening,  the electronic pseudo-symphonic music of Memory does not approach the  beauty or dynamics of an orchestra with real people playing real  instruments. Nor does Enya's multi-layering of her own voice have the same  rich sonic texture as a chorus comprised of real voices.

However, a post-Chrissie Hynde list would be too long for here. I'm not certain if Chrissie paved the road for ladies in rock, but the statement has considerable validity. When Chrissie appeared on the scene in 1980 with Pretenders I, the rules of the rock ball game were discarded, then rewritten. Like Patti Smith, Chrissie Hynde is a take-charge no-excuses babe - composer and lyricist, guitar heroine, and band leader.

The other guy-bands shook in their high-heeled boots, and rightly so.

Producer Peter Asher\\'s use of county effects (steel guitar on `Willing\\'), lump-in-the-throat strings (Heart Like A Wheel), and floor shaking bass guitar (When Will I Be Loved) is perfectly balanced.I\\'d also like to credit Linda Ronstadt for promoting the exquisite work of Canadian singer/songwriters Kate and Anna McGarrigle, and mentoring another gifted singer/songwriter - Wendy Waldman.

I consider her to be one of the few female singers who in my opinion can still make some great angelic melodies that don't sound banal or cheap even though some of her songs are so short as to be almost like unfinished demo tapes( Will she someday produce and compose a song that is about eight ot nine minutes long). The Memory Of Trees is my second favorite CD of hers behing Watermark which I consider to be her strongest outing to date. I doubt Enya will topple Watermark to tell you the truth.Many people say that this is a sunny album. Well, it is kind of true. The sunniness is evidenced on the title track, Anywhere Is, and the Orinoco Flow-esque On My Way Home. Generally I think of this album as an album for a cloudy, romantic autumn evening with the leaves a bright red, orange and yellow. Several songs are quite dark and cloudy but not stormy like let's say Storms In Africa, Exile, or creepy like Evening Falls. This album is a gorgeous musical journey that trancends boundaries. I find this to be like the darker companion to the sunniness of A Day Without Rain which followed this one five years later.I usually go with the darker material that Enya does but I enjoy the brighter material as well( I love music that is dark and stormy).The title track is a gorgeous instrumental that has Enya returning to the days of the Celts CD. Instead of the usual piano instrumental that introduced us to Watermark, Shephard Moons, and A Day Without Rain we get a song that is more synthesized and with thundering beats to bop your head to combined with Enyas multilayered vocals that starts out as a cloudy minor note and after about 30 seconds it morphs into a major note to give an impression of the sun shining through the clouds on a warm autumn afternoon. This song is more similar to the Celts than the piano instrumentals of most of her albums although this song is much brighter than the Celts title track. Anywhere Is is like the blueprint of Enyas big-selling A Day Without Rain. It's a very bright, sunny song with rhythm that could make you almost bop your head along with. This song is more legato although there are hints of the staccato pizzicato strings that would dominate a lot of Enyas A Day Without Rain. I love the quiet middle part of the song. It kind of reminds me of the quiet bridge of Orinoco Flow a few years before then. After the sunniness we head into darker, mistier territory of Pax Deorum. This song is another dark almost Gothic piece that features Enya singing in Latin with a very misty feel. In the middle of the song the rhythm pauses and the sing becomes a major note for about a minute giving an imression of the sun breaking through the dark clouds. I consider this to be Enyas best 'Gothic' song to this day. It's almost like the darker side of Heaven if you could call it that. The song reverts back into a dark misty minor note song. Athair Ar Neamh is a very sad, cloudy evening song that features Enya singing in Gaelic. This song is a very beautiful, theme for a guy who is having a lonely summer. The song ends in a major note key like the sun breaking out just before it goes down. From Where I am is a beautiful piano instrumental. China Roses is a gorgeous, breathtaking, ambient song that made me get this album. It's one of Enyas most stunning compositions to date in my opinion. China Roses is a very romantic song that brings up images two lovers walking alongside the waterfront with the red leaves falling onto the surface of a pond with a large garden of roses and a huge crystal castle in the background. China Roses is one of Enyas most brilliant songs to this day. This song is the winner on the Memory Of Trees. Hope Has A Place is a another beautiful song that is similar to China Roses although not quite as powerful or mind- stimulating but still great. This song is a song about how hope is still existant even in bleak situations. This song reminds me of How Can I Keep From Singing from Shepard Moons. Tea-House Moon is one of the best Enya instrumentals I have ever listened to. It's a very stunning song with high pitched synths in the background with electronic synths in the foreground. This song is one to enjoy when it's cloudy and the red leaves are falling to the ground. This song is one of my favorites off this CD. Once You Had Gold is one song that you probably shouldn't play if you have not had much sleep because it's one song that will sooth your soul. I fell asleep in class a few times in the past listening to this song *giggles*. This song though is great though. I enjoy it alot on a cloudy evening. La Sonadora is a very haunting song that features Enya singing in Spanish. This song is very dark and spooky although not stormy or scary as let's say Exile, Storms In Africa or the dynamite Na Leatha Geal M'Oige but this song is one of the darker songs off this album. The chants remind me a bit of Smaointe from a decade ago. We brighten up again with the closing track On My Way Home. This song that contains many elements of the 1988 hit Orinoco Flow although not as spooky as that one. This song is much brighter than Orinoco and happier. This song is like the predecessor to the brightness of A Day Without Rain that followed this one five years later...I consider this to be one of Enyas strongest albums to date. Only Watermark surpasses this one and it's not by too much. I strongly recommend that all Enya fans buy this amazing masterpiece.

Most of this album is very lightweight compared to \"Mezzanine\" but on it\\'s own \"Protection\" has plenty to offer.My favorite tracks are the title track, \"Karmacoma\" and \"Weatherstorm\".The title track is easily the best track on this entire album. This track to me is one of the best mid 1990s chill-out tracks featuring a very nice hip-hop beat, and Tracey Thorn\\'s absolutely crystal clear vocals which dominate this track. Wow! She sounds absolutely incredible on this track. This album is worth buying just for the title track alone. \"Karmacoma\" is another favorite track of mines with an excellent blend of chill-out dance and some reggae elements. The somewhat subdued rapping is actually quite good.ALthough no bad songs by any stretch of the imagination, this album starts to kind of go all over the place and somewhat meander aimlessly in places.\"Weather Storm\" is actually quite a fantastic and a great romantic relaxing song to listen to while basking in the sun on a summer evening but even though I really love this track, this one belongs on a smooth jazz Cd or on a smooth jazz station. I could actually recall hearing this on a smoothe jazz station one time a while back but had no idea that it was actually Massive Attack. But because I love smooth jazz, I actually enjoy this track but it feels way out of place on this album. Still \"Weather Storm\" is a great track and one of my favorites so it\\'s completely forgiveable. It\\'s just that \"Weather Storm\" felt like someone else\\'s recording was accidentally put on this album. That\\'s all.The album picks back up on \"Spying Glass\" which is a really cool trancy dance song with a slight reggae-ish edge to it and great, if somewhat, weird vocals by Andy.This CD starts to meander off from here forth. I actually found \"Better Things\" to be bland and unremarkable despite having the crystal clear vocals from Tracey Thorn. The beat is weak and the song feels unfinished almost like a demo tape. Still, not bad but nothing to write home about.Although the remaining tracks are enjoyable to an extent, they aren\\'t a lot to write home about either. The live version of \"Light My Fire\" though is interesting.It\\'s really ironic how this album showcased almost nothing of the darkness and dark inner psyche that would ultimately culminate in what I consider the greatest trip hop album of all time \"Mezzanine\" three years later.\"Protection\" may be their weakest album but don\\'t let the word \"weakest\" I typed here deter you from getting this album. Do not look for anything in the vein of \"Mezzanine\" nor \"100th Window\" but if you are willing to check it out on it\\'s own merits, this album will be better than what most have made it out to be, perhaps even more than I have written it out to be.', 'overall': 4.0, 'summary': 'Uneven album but plenty of good stuff saves it. 3.8 stars', 'unixReviewTime': 1078012800, 'reviewTime': '02 29, 2004'}, {'reviewerID': 'A3EJYJC25OJVKK', 'asin': 'B000000WGF', 'reviewerName': 'Distant Voyageur \"Nicholas Computer\"', 'helpful': [2, 3], 'reviewText': 'This 1988 debut album is straight up fun as the song of the same name suggests.

The lyrics are a bit disturbing but also really vivid and well-written. The opening track \"The Way That You Love Me\" has some suprisingly good lyrics even if they are rather cheesy at best. \"Opposites Attract\" is all out fun and was a huge hit in early 1990 and featured an unforgettable video featuring that animated cartoon cat dancing alongside Paula in the video. The version on here though doesn\\'t have the rap section like the hit version does. The only ballad on here is \"Next Two You\" which is really a very pleasant song and really good electrical 80s sounding guitar parts and beautiful synthesizers.While some of the tracks have since started to sound a little dated, others however sometimes while sounding dated sometimes sound new and up to date once again.

First, David Gahan, their lead singer nearly died of a heroin overdose in 1996 but miraculously cleaned himself up and rejoined the band. The other blow to the group was the departure of Alan Wilder. Despite the calamities, Depeche Mode returned in 1997 with their ninth studio album and their first as a trio and &#65533;Ultra&#65533; doesn&#65533;t disappoint one bit. In fact this album surpassed all of my expectations.Dark, frightening, eerie, and mature are the words to describe the mood of this album. The blurry black, purple and white colors in the background perfect suit the overall mood of the CD. The black and dark purple portray the darkness of the lyrics, and of the music. The lighter colors portray the sense of hope, redemption, recovery, and moving forward after near demise. These are just how I see them. This album makes me think of running through a severe rainstorm and embracing it&#65533;s darkness and intensity. That&#65533;s how I describe the albums mood.This album is a departure from the heavily guitar driven style of &#65533;Songs Of Faith & Devotion&#65533; and more of a return to the keyboard based pop of their signature but maintaining some of the SOFAD elements. Overall though, this album has a completely different mood from SOFAD or Violator or the ones before them. Depeche once again morphed their style and for me, I like change even though a small part of me yearns for a Black Celebration Part II. This album is definitely an &#65533;ULTRA&#65533; masterpiece. There&#65533;s some sense of joy and happiness meshed in with the angry, depressed atmosphere of the songs. This album is in my opinion, the extreme opposite of &#65533;Speak & Spell&#65533;. Every song on this essential CD is at least a 4 and a half but &#65533;Home&#65533;, &#65533;It&#65533;s No Good&#65533;, &#65533;Freestate&#65533;, and &#65533;Insight&#65533; are by far the best on this CD with &#65533;Insight&#65533; being the best of all. There&#65533;s plenty to find in every song on this album.&#65533;Barrel Of A Gun&#65533; starts things off with a guitar-driven, and menacing song that SOFAD fans will more than likely enjoy. This song almost sounds like a Nine Inch Nails track at times. &#65533;The Love Thieves&#65533; is a jazzier, and trippier song that foreshadows the lighter direction that the group would take on their next album four years later. I like this songs odd chord structure. &#65533;Home&#65533; starts with a somewhat scary melody and a screeching sound effect that reminds me of a ghost screaming in the distance. It starts as a dark, and disturbing song with a dark and eerie mood and becomes a warm, orchestral song. I love the climax with the rock guitars and the orchestras coming together at the climax. Martin Gore has never sounded better on this track in his entire career. &#65533;It&#65533;s No Good&#65533; radiates with its pulsating bass, and punching beats. This song from perspective is about how searching for love is just in vain &#65533;Don&#65533;t say you love me, cause it&#65533;s no good&#65533;. &#65533;Uselink&#65533; is a cute electronic instrumental. &#65533;Useless&#65533; is a definite SOFAD-esque song with a somewhat of a Soundgarden-esque sound. This song reminds me somewhat of &#65533;Black Hole Sun&#65533; from years ago. Great song. &#65533;Sister Of Night&#65533; is a beautiful and textural song with a bitter and dark mood. I like the strange guitar, or keyboard sound effects. &#65533;Jazz Thieves&#65533; is another cute and instrumental. We then head into one of my favorite tracks on the CD &#65533;Freestate&#65533;. This song is one of the best songs of Depeche Mode&#65533;s career. It starts off with a dark and eerie melody and some gorgeous 12 string guitars and becomes an intense and brooding song with rumbling beats and keyboards that remind of &#65533;Enjoy The Silence&#65533; from &#65533;Violator&#65533;. When I play this song, I can imagine myself tangoing with a woman dressed in black in a severe thunderstorm on an open city plaza. ;-) The ending is really cool too. I wished that this song would&#65533;ve been released as a single. &#65533;The Bottom Line&#65533; is a bittersweet song with a bit of a country flavor but still being very dark and bitter in mood. The closing track &#65533;Insight&#65533;  is by far my favorite song on this CD. It starts as an ominous electronic number with a dark black & white mood, and then becomes an uplifting electronic Gospel influenced song with a sense of hope and looking towards the future. Wait and minute, it&#65533;s not the closer. The real closer on this CD is actually a hidden track called &#65533;Junior Painkiller&#65533;. This short instrumental is an odd and bizarre song. It&#65533;s a great song  but &#65533;Insight&#65533; should&#65533;ve been the closer. This is a good instrumental nonetheless.&#65533;Ultra&#65533; was a vital outing for DM, not only because it was great but because it showed that even with Wilder&#65533;s absence, they could still crank out the good songs. While I enjoy  &#65533;Exciter&#65533; a lot, &#65533;Ultra&#65533; in my opinion a sense of edge, heaviness, the darkness, and a bit of fright, that I feel was missing from the 2001 release. For me, Depeche Mode shines when they make dark, frightening, electronically intense songs than simply mellow, joyous songs but maybe it&#65533;s just because I embrace dark music.Alan Wilder&#65533;s departure could&#65533;ve spelled the end of Depeche Mode or if they carried on, they could&#65533;ve used every excuse to put out a dud of an album or even disbanded.

This is the best hits compilation I,ve ever bought. Many people think of Shout or Everybody Wants To Rule The World when they think of TFF. While I love these songs their music spans beyond just these two songs. You'll be surprised at the changes in their sound from their Hurting Days. Pale Shelter, and Mad World are your typical but above average early 80s new wave songs. Change is a standout song from this period. Such a well produced pop song. The fuzz buzz running from 2:38 to 2:57 is amazing. The new single on here is a hard rock edged Laid So Low. This song is a rerecorded version of Tears Roll Down from the brilliant yet underrated Saturnine Martial Lunatic CD. The next surpise is the Beatles sounding Sowing The Seeds Of Love. Rolands songwriting` producing, and Curts voice and musicianship all come together to create a brilliant 6 and a half minute song. This is their most colorful song they,ve ever done with lots of horns and trumpets. The other surprise is the soulful Woman In Chains and Advice For The Young At Heart. Woman In Chains is a beautiful song with Oleta Adams singing backup and emotional well written lyrics. Her voice is breathtaking. The Final Cut on this compilation, Advice For The Young is a great closer to this album. It's very soulful with the Jazzy pianos mixed with guitars and organs it's my favorite on this album.

This album is sort of like The Seeds Of Love but this album is darker, far more pessismistic, and not as complex or colorful but it still ranks side by side with the Big Chair as my second favorite TFF album.The title track kicks off this CD with a bang with a turbulent stormy ambient rock sound and a much darker feel than anything off their Seeds Of Love LP. The song starts off with chimes ringing and then it becomes a dance/rock track to make you get up on your feet and dance. Cold despite it's title is warmer and brighter than it's predecessor. Cold is a rock song to make you feel good with a fun melody and awesome beats. Break It Down Again was the sole top 40 hit off this album. It's a cool song with a beautiful melody, brilliant vocals, and cool acoustic guitars. I enjoy the snares at the beginning of the song. This song is probably the brightest song on this entire LP. We then mellow down with the dark grey cloudiness of Mr. Pessimist. I probably relate all to well with this song just simply from it's minor note feel with small amounts of major notes here and there. Mr. Pessismist is a very jazzy, moody song with electronic guitar sways in the distance and awesome bass hooks. Pessimist earns the crown as the best song on Elemental. This song is kind of like dark clouds racing across the sky with the sun desparately trying to break through the on the horizon. Dogs A Best Friends Dog is a hard rocking number that jolts you back up after the mellowness of Pessimist. Dogs is one song to crank up your stereo to. This song could have charted higher than Break It Down Again had it been released as a single. The song ends with a breeze sound effect introducing the next song. Fish Out Of Water is a more synthesized song with killer keyboards and a danceable. This song was a song that expressed Rolands grudge against his former bandmate Curt Smith. I hope Curt Smith doesn't get mad at me *giggles* but I love this song. Gas Giants is a dark almost New Agey almost interlude track with an airy feel and a cloudy day feel. Power is similar to Break It Down Again but this song is longer and better. This song is another great song. I love the synthesized voice blends in so well with the music, total contrast to the annoying computerized voice effects that have dogged a lot of todays popular music. I do enjoy the jazzy quiet part from 3:22 to 4:00. Brian Wilson Said made me buy this album. It starts off as a very 60s sound track for the first minute and 50 seconds. The song then becomes a very mellow jazzy song that could be played on a smooth jazz station. This song is beautiful.  Goodnight Song is a sad yet happy song that is somewhat similar to Advice For The Young At Heart. It has a similar drum loop although played on different drums. I believe Goosnight is a tribute to the people who attended his concerts over the years. This song almost made me cry with tears of joy. This song is very deep and emotional. Where the title track was a stormy beginning to this album Goodnight Song is like a mission completed and succeeded.It's a pity that this marvelous album was eclipsed by the grunge movement back during it's release. It was great back in 1993 when it came out and today it is an absolute classic. This is no Big Chair. I doubt TFF will ever make another big Chair again. That task might as well be left to some future band who might follow in their footsteps. Fans of the Hurting and Big Chair LPs might not care much for Elemental but fans of The Seeds Of Love will love this album. This is an album that still is fighting for it's place in the annals of rock history.Elemental took my breath away upon first listening back in 1994. Elemental has power and edge that surpasses the 1995 follow-up Raoul & And The Kings Of Spain which somehow didn't quite match Elemental.

It primarily has that typical early 1980s New Wave to it except this album is far FAR above most of that ... 80s fluff and has far more poetic lyrics.

Basically it has an apocolyptic feel lyrically as is shone on 'Start Of The Breakdown' and 'Mad World'.The edition I'm reviewing is the remastered edition with four bonus tracks.It's hard for me to explain the tracks in detail but I can say this CD is great and is a must have for any 80s lover like myself.The term '... 80s fluff' I mentioned earlier does not necessarily mean I don't like 80s music. Contrarily I love 80s music. Just that I tend to enjoy some of the lesser known 80s hits.Hurting is much lighter and less heavy than its successor 'Songs From The Big Chair' and is much more synth pop than 'The Seeds Of Love'. It seems strange that this album is from the same band who would eventually evolve from a synth-pop group into a more soul-rock sounding group with that 1989 masterpiece.This Cd had little notice here in the US when it came out in 1983 but it did well in England. Tears For Fears would have two year to go before setting the charts on fire in 1984 with 'Shout' and again in 1985 with EWTRTW(The name is so long I sometimes don't feeling like typing out the whole name).Unlike the bonus tracks in The Big Chair and Seeds Of Love the bonuc tracks while good kind of dissapointed me a smidgey bit. The World Remix of Mad World is dead identical to the original version except with a more echoing beat. This version is still good.The other three are good to excellent. The Way You Are on here is extended to almost 8 minutes long. I love the extended versions of Pale Shelter and Change. The extended verison of Mad World has a less metallic beat and the beat is more flat. The version of Change is extended to six minutes for more listening pleasure.My favorite track besides the bonus tracks is 'Start Of The Breakdown'. This song is like the blueprint of what was to come on The Big Chair and this song could have fit well on that album.This CD is worth having if you love Tears For Fears but I would start with The Big Chair and The Seeds Of Love. Then I would get this one. Oh what the hell get all of TFFs albums.\", 'overall': 5.0, 'summary': 'Great kickstart for the best band in the world', 'unixReviewTime': 1019865600, 'reviewTime': '04 27, 2002'}, {'reviewerID': 'A3EJYJC25OJVKK', 'asin': 'B000001FC0', 'reviewerName': 'Distant Voyageur \"Nicholas Computer\"', 'helpful': [10, 11], 'reviewText': \"For many TFF fans, The Big Chair album will be forever remembered for it's giant hits 'Shout' and Everybody Wants To Rule The World' as well as the lesser number 3 hit 'Head Over Heels'.For me while Shout and Everybody Wants To Rule The World are some of the best songs the 80s had to offer, this album has far more to offer than just those two songs alone. I enjoy the parent album versions of Shout and EWTRTW more than the shortened versions that have often appeared on many 80s compilations. I hate when they shorten the great Shout to only 4 minutes. It decreases it's listenability. On the other hand I love the 6 and a half minute version far more.While Shout and EWTRTW are absolute classics, I often find myself listening to a lot of the other songs on this album more than those two major hits. For example, The Working Hour is in my opinion an incredible song with a strong disturbing melody filled with passion that burns like fire and radiates more emotion and talent with the first few notes of the synthesizers alone than anything that most of todays throwaway artist exhibit on their entire albums. The Working Hour is one of the best songs TFF have ever composed and is one of the major highlights.The song Head Over Heels is a rich and powerful song. The version on the Tears Roll Down and Shout: Very Best Of TFF CDs ends with just the voice echoing away. On The Big Chair LP, the ending merges with a live performance of Broken that greatly increases it;s listening capibility. It ends with the sound of a crowd cheering ushering in Listen. Listen is a very ominous song with almost apocolyptic lyrics and a dark, brooding atmosphere and thundering beats that sends chills through me during every listen.The version of The Big Chair I,m reviewing is the remastered version. The original version realeased in February of 1985 had only eight tracks. The remastered edition features seven bonus tracks for an even greater spectrum of TFFs incredible talent. The first three bonus The Big Chair, The Maurauders, and Empire Building, tracks are also available on the B-Sides Rarities collection Saturnine Martial Lunatic. These are moslty quirky instrumentals that casual fans might not enjoy too much but for me, I love every second of them. The Conflict is a song that was previously unreleased. It's a cool song with almost Phil Collins-like beats and bizarre electronic blips. The other three bonus tracks are remixes. Broken Revistited is longer than the original version although less powerful and not as heavy but still great.The remix of Mothers Talk was the hit version, not the heavier parent album version. I love both versions. The remix version is more jazzy and not quite as aggressive. The U.S. remix of Shout is an eight minute mix that is great. Although it does not do the original version justice at least this is like a good reworking of the song.I,m so glad I got the remastered version of this CD. In fact I have all three of TFFs first three albums remastered.For all fans of 80s music get this incredible CD. I would recommend the Remastered edition more because it's almost twice as long as the 1985 version and with 15 tracks instead of just 8.This is definately one of the best albums of the 20th Century. Don't stop there get the Seeds Of Love next. You'll be surprised at the difference between these two masterpieces. Get The Hurting as well but get the Big Chair and Seeds Of Love. Grrrrrr... Just get every TFF CD.

While the Big Chair was a heavily synth laden record this one fuses blues, jazz, rock, and soul to create the most colorful masterpiece I,ve ever heard. There hasen't been a better moment in music than late 1989. This edition I,m reviewing is the remastered with four bonus tracks.Heres my review for each song starting with the first eight tracks...Woman In Chains is a breathtaking power ballad with Oleta Adams on guest vocals. Her voice is unbelievable. This is one of the most soul grabbing song TFF have ever done. Badmans Song is a rock Blues driven song with lots of hammond organs with cool drums and Oleta Adams as guest vocal. This song is eight minutes and a half minutes long. Sowing The Seeds Of Love is similar to Badmans Song but more pop sounding than the previous one. It has cool trumpets laced with cool guiters. Unfortunately this is the only song to feature Curt Smiths excellent voice on this entire record. This was the big hit off this album. Advice For The Young At Heart is my favorite song on this CD. It is a very soul driven song with very powerful lyrics that will grab your soul. The ambient rock bridge in the middle is breathtaking. I almost cried with joy listening to this song. I love the echoing piano at the ending. Standing On The Corner Of The Third World is a haunting song with some Arab horns at the biginning and ambient organs. It becomes an almost gospel like song in the middle. The last minute features harmonica playing. The song speed up in the last 20 seconds and the fades out. Sword And Knives is a cool song with blips at the biginnings and ending. It then becomes a jazzy rock song and then becomes a hard driven rock song at the middle. Year Of The Knife is a great song with fast paced drums and rocking guitars. It begins with a crowd cheering. This song is great. Famous Last Words is a beautiful song that begins with a siren and piano for the first minute and a half. It then becomes an orchestra sounding song for the next minute. At 2:24 it blows up to become a power ballad with breathtaking lyrics that will reach your soul. It then slows back down and the siren sound effects kick back then fades out. This is a great closer to the orgininal version of this album.And now on to the bonus tracks.......Tears Roll Down is the primitive version of Laid So Low from the 1992 Greatest Hits but darker and less rock sounding. It builds up over the first two minutes with chanting and triangle sound clicks. It then blows up to become an ambient rock sounding song for about thirty seconds and then quiets back down and fades out. Always In The Past is a fast paced song that could,ve made it one this album. It has horns playing throughout the song. I love the ambient rock bridge in the middle of the song. Music For Tables is a smooth jazz instrumental. It's very nice and laid back and doesn't appear on the Saturnine Martial Lunatic CD. Johnny Panic &amp; The Bible Of Dreams is a song that has the chord structure of Shout but with hip-hop beats and the lyrics of Sowing The Seeds Of Love sung is a rap chorus in a great way. This version is more edgy and less DJ oriented than the version on the Saturnine Martial Lunatic CD. A cool closer to this masterpiece.This is the best pop album I,ve ever heard in my life. It's the fun music that I miss so much in music these days. But whatever the future brings in music this album will definately hold up to the tests of time. In fact it doesn't sound dated at all and sounds more up to date than any of the antiquated rap/r&amp;b garbage on the radio these days. Go and buy this CD. It's worth the price you'd pay.Over and Out...\", 'overall': 5.0, 'summary': 'The ever growing tree of life', 'unixReviewTime': 1003276800, 'reviewTime': '10 17, 2001'}, {'reviewerID': 'A3EJYJC25OJVKK', 'asin': 'B000001FZH', 'reviewerName': 'Distant Voyageur \"Nicholas Computer\"', 'helpful': [1, 2], 'reviewText': 'I just cannot understand how a record like this that spawned four smash hits on the radio back in 1990 and 1991 could go virtually unnoticed and ultimately just be in the category of cult hits. When four singles lifted from it in fact make it into the top ten and are still very popular to this day, yet the parent album is almost forgotten completely baffles me to this day. With four top ten hits, one would assume that this album would at least go platinum but it barely dented the charts despite the runaway popularity of the songs that were released as singles. I bought a copy of this album in the summer of 1999 and a whole bunch of memories came flooding back to me with songs like 1989\\'s \"Come on And Get My Love\", \"Just Another Dream\" and \"Everybody Move\", and without a doubt the timeless classic \"Touch Me All Night Long\". \"Move To This\" remains a staple album of early 1990s Eurodance pop and remains one of the albums that while mostly centering the dance pop styles of that era has aged unbelievably gracefully and surprisingly doesn\\'t sound dated at all even when placed against some newer music.The cheese factor is evident in many areas of this album but the cheese factor instead just makes this album all the more fun to listen to and to escape from the negativity of today\\'s world. The most blatant cheese factor is mostly centered on the suprisngly bland album cover with it\\'s rather odd color scheme and the sometimes laughable Louise Brooks hairdo. The rather unappealing color scheme used on the album cover on both the front and back with it\\'s texture, is virtually opposite to the immensely edgy and rich style that permeate the albums music altogether. It\\'s definitely not the worst album cover even by a long shot but the sometimes plain look is deceiving because the music is far from plain.While \"Touch Me All Night Long\" is remembered with it\\'s electrifying techno beat and Dennis\\' excellent vocals, the version on this parent album is VERY different from the remix that most dance fans are familiar with and is one of the great suprises that this album offers. The version that most people are familiar with has that unforgettable Europop techno beat and strong basslines along with those tinkling low-pitched keyboard effects but the version on here is very different but every bit as good albeit in a very different light. The version on the parent album is less techno-oriented, funkier and more jolly in sound and is slightly jazzier in sound as well. The techno version is the more popular version but the album version is a must-hear just to hear this classic in a totally different light.Some of the other tracks besides \"Come On and Get Your Love\" and \"All Night Long\" however warrant a great deal of attention. \"Too Many Walls\" is perhaps the most unique track on this album and was a well-deserved top ten hit in the fall of 1990. The song melody wise has the undertones that would make it a moody ballad but at the same time, the track has a danceable metallic beat that would make it a wonderful semi-ballad/semi-dance track. The song combines the elements of a ballad and the elements of a dance track. Quite something to hear. The moody melody of the track and the unique chord changes that permeate the track are just a delight to my ears and remains one of the highlight tracks. While it may have been out for many years, \"Too Many Walls\" doesn\\'t sound dated at all and in fact defies a lot of late 1980s/early 1990s trends as well and that\\'s quite an achievement. The saxophones and Flugel horns during the middle of the track from 2:56 until the track rises a whole step in melody is absolutely incredible and that along makes this track a timeless classic in my book.The orchestral ending of \"Too Many Walls\" perfectly blends into the moodiest and most emotional song on this album \"Tell Me\". Blending Europop balladry and moody Quiet Storm atmosphere \"Tell Me\" is another highlight on this album. Cathy Dennis\\'s vocals are absolutely incredible and are among the best singing she\\'s ever done and is ironically hardly cheesy at all. The lyrics are very good as well and are in fact quite impressive even by dance-artists\\' standards. The beauty of the ambient keyboards and soft vocals are really amazing and \"Tell Me\" is another one of the best tracks on this album.The only occasional drawback is that most of the dance tracks do sometimes suffer from sounding very similar to each other at times but that is offset by the different styles that are unique to them. \"Everybody Move\", the longest track on this short album (5:15) is a very Prince-influenced track with a mix of late 1980s Europop keyboard effects and rock drum beats to create a really unique and colorful track. I would even go far enough to say that it would almost perfectly fit on Prince\\'s \"Grafitti Bridge\" soundtrack against \"Round and Round\", another wonderful classic but that\\'s up for another review on the future. The title track is another excellent dance track with a really good rhythm and keyboard styles.\"My Beating Heart\" is the cheesiest song on this album and sounds the most dated of the tracks on this album. While it is certainly my least favorite track on this album, the cheese factor present is offset by the horn instruments and the moodiness of the melody. The beat though is really cool and while this was the track that took the longest to get into mainly because of the cheese factor, it is yet another great track even if I give it let\\'s say a 4.7 versus a perfect 5 or more for every other track on this album.The remaining two tracks \"Got to Get Your Love\" and \"Taste My Love\" close this album on a glorious note. \"Got To Get Your Love\" is a high-energy dance pop track with pulsating beats, unique keyboards effects, and a fun big city party vibe to it. The tambourine effects towards the last minute of the track are really fun to listen to. The final track \"Taste My Love\" is on the border of being pure cheesy with it\\'s outright cheesy lyrics but the song overall is a great dance track. The song ends this wonderful trip on a highly confident note.\"Move To This\" is without a doubt a staple in the history of dance pop music of the early 1990s and is one of the greatest albums of that era. While mostly centering on the styles of the era, the album has aged incredibly well and avoids ending up in the era of dated pop fluff.

Yes, it's my least favorite album of PGs catalog but that does not mean that PG2 is a weak album. On the contrary, it's a very good album that is much better than what it's given credit for.This CD strongly benifits from the remastering that was given as when I owned the original version a long time ago, the sound quality of the music was very muddy. Robert Fripp probably takes alot of heat for the lousy production but it's not as badly produced as most ppl say. In fact, I might sound odd but I actually love it's raw production, being free of the more electronically produced material on Gabriel's later works following this one, and instead the music overall is kind of like as it were being recorded live on tape especially the angry D.I.Y. and the morbid yet beautiful Home Sweet Home. In The Air, Perspective and Animal Magic are fun upbeat rockers while the eerie White Shadow and Mother Of Violence are gorgeous ballads. I don't think this album is all that dark like Security or Melting Face but it's concept is relatively bleak although more like cloudy winter afternoon bleak as opposed to the murderous, and frightening Melting Face or the window shattering Security. For those who are mostly into the synthesized materpiece So or the worldly pop colored Us, PG2 is unlikely to be the best disc to easily appreciate as it's probably the most abstract, experiment, and the least accessible album that Peter has ever put out.If you already appreciate the (more) famous albums of his, then if you're willing to take a dive into the early, more experimental music, welcome to PG2.

This album in a way continues some of the elements of that album but in this case is an improvement over that one and some of the songs are many years ahead of their time thanks in part to innovative for the time recording techniques and this album as a whole still sounds fresh and new to this day even after almost 21 years after it&#65533;s release. I must say that this album has aged much better than &#65533;No Jacket Required&#65533; in a way. Those who loved &#65533;In The Air Tonight&#65533; will definitely cherish this album as it has similar songs like the dark and ominous &#65533;I Don&#65533;t Care Anymore&#65533; and &#65533;Do You Know, Do You Care?&#65533;. &#65533;Do You Know Do You Care&#65533; gets my nod as the angriest and most raging song that Collins has ever composed and I would say that it&#65533;s even angrier, more intense, and even better than &#65533;In The Air Tonight&#65533; especially with the menacing keyboards and the extremely explosive ending where the song echoes away into the night. Phil Collins sounds awesome when he&#65533;s angry and Pyssed off.I have to say that the best songs on this CD are tied between &#65533;Do You Know Do You Care&#65533;, &#65533;Thru These Walls&#65533;, and &#65533;The West Side&#65533;. &#65533;I Cannot Believe It&#65533;s True&#65533;, &#65533;It Don&#65533;t Matter To Me&#65533;, &#65533;Don&#65533;t Let Him Steal Your Heart Away&#65533; are your typical but classic sentimental Collins classics. Overall though, ALL of these 10 songs are great&#65533;ALL OF THEM!&#65533;I Don&#65533;t Care Anymore&#65533; continues the dark and angry backlash theme of &#65533;In The Air Tonight&#65533; with similar betas and dark atmosphere. &#65533;I Cannot Believe It&#65533;s True&#65533; is a much brighter and funkier song and is more upbeat than the previous but more upbeat and not as ominous. &#65533;Like China&#65533; is a great and danceable rocker with great and memorable hooks and rocking guitars. &#65533;Do You Know, Do You Care&#65533; is by far the angriest and most turbulent song that Phil has ever composed. The things that make it so angry and so great to listen to are the combination of dark ambient sound, angry lyrics and Phil hitting the highest notes that he has ever managed to hit. This song alone makes this an essential CD.  The echoing rock guitars at the ending are unforgettable. If Collins was a ticking timebomb when he did &#65533;In The Air Tonight&#65533;, DYKDYC is the song where the timebomb (Collins) explodes. The main hit off this album was a cover version of the 60s classic &#65533;You Can&#65533;t Hurry Love&#65533; and I must say, this is a great song to dance to and is a great ode to Motown. This song has a very strong 60s feel to it and is a great cover of the original. This song probably earned Collins the &#65533;Nice Guy&#65533; title. &#65533;I Doesn&#65533;t Matter To Me&#65533; is a much happier song with lots of Phoenix Horns and great rhythm and vocals. &#65533;Thru These Walls&#65533; is a haunting mid-tempo song with a dark and mysterious mood. I think of this as a pre-cursor to &#65533;One More Night&#65533; and &#65533;Do You Remember&#65533;. TTW is a tale of a guy hearing his wife or girlfriend making love with another lover from another room, through the walls. &#65533;Don&#65533;t Let Him Steal Your Heart Away&#65533; is typical but great and unforgettable Collins&#65533; mid-tempo balladry. &#65533;The West Side&#65533; is the most intriguing song on this entire CD. It starts with a great mix of cymbals and thundering drums before blasting into an awesome instrumental with a marvelous blend of jazz, pop, and rock before reaching the climax with Phil singing &#65533;Yeah!!!Yeah!!!Yeah!!!&#65533; towards the ending. There are lots of Phenix Horns that are heard on a lot of Earth Wind & Fire&#65533;s music and the brass instruments in this instrumental song make it so much more compelling to listen to. I love this song much more than his other instrumentals even though they are good too. The album wraps up with &#65533;Why Can&#65533;t It Wait til Morning&#65533; as an orchestral ballad and one of Phil&#65533;s best of his pre-1985 ballads. There is a gorgeous cover version done by jazz group Fourplay that features him that is available on their &#65533;Best Of Fourplay&#65533; CD. It&#65533;s absolutely amazing and improves this song.This album is a definite must for all the PC-Heads out there in the world. Phil Collins is one of the few artists out there who hasn&#65533;t lost one bit of magic over the years and has maintained all of it the whole time even with &#65533;Testify&#65533;. In a way, I think that this album has aged better than most of &#65533;No Jacket Required&#65533; mainly because of the more &#65533;live&#65533; sounding instruments and REAL drums as opposed to the tons of drum machines used on the follow-up album three years later. Perhaps we should bring this style of sound back into our stereos again to combat the sick state of music again don&#65533;t you think?Anyway, HIMBG is a definite essential for all PC fans and is one of the best albums of 1982! I would even go far as to say that I enjoy this album more than let&#65533;s say &#65533;Thriller&#65533; but not as much as Peter Gabriel&#65533;s &#65533;Security&#65533;.

Yet there are several other great track to check out on this CD.Long Long Way To Go is totally opposite to the other tracks on this CD. It's very atmospheric moody and almost melancholy. I almost call it the dark clouds on an otherwise relatively sunny album. Its one of my favorites. The song ends with the recording being interrupted instead of fading out.Don't Lose My Number gives me a feeling of nostalgia. It's one of the best songs from the 80s. Definately a highlight.There is one bonus track called We Said Hello Goodbye. It's a melancholy yet uplifting song at the same time. I believe this is a bonus track available only on CD(Thank God I get my music on CD).Sussudio kind of reminds me of Princes 1999 with similar bass hooks and drum rhythm and keyboards.The truth is I enjoy the whole album.

For all of the chaotic changes overtaking the world around the end of the decade and the transition into the Post-Cold War period especially with the tearing down of the Berlin Wall, 1989 also in my opinion was the greatest year for music and this album closes the year as well as the decade out on a high note. The hauntingly beautiful classic \"Another Day In Paradise\" was a childhood favorite and a song that had a profound impact on me during my childhood.Hot off the heals of the success of the 1986 classic \"Invisible Touch\" with his band Genesis along with a phenomenally successful tour, Phil Collins returns to his solo arena and takes the drivers seat once again with his fourth and best solo album of his career 1989\\'s timeless \"But Seriously\" and the title is spot on perfect. Gone is most of the sunny summertime tropical flavor of \"No Jacket Required\" and the sound is far more serious and more dramatic than anything he\\'s ever done before. While no stranger to socially conscious lyrics, (he did many socially conscious songs with Genesis), the lyrics are also much darker, more powerful, and among the most thought-provoking I\\'ve ever listened to but they are backed up by utterly powerful anthems with songs like \"Colours\", and \"Another Day In Paradise\". To me \"But Seriously\" is without a doubt Phil Collins\\' pinnacle of his solo career, or his entire music career altogether.Along onboard on this successful project both commercially and artistically, is a wide variety of friends and guest musicians on many of the tracks. They range from David Crosby, to former Policeman Sting, to even his former band mate Peter Gabriel. Eric Clapton is the one who plays the blues-sounding guitar on his smash hit ballad \"I Wish It Would Rain\" down. While not immediately noticeable but Sting is also present on the background and one can hear him if one has good ears.\"That\\'s Just The Way It Is\" is an eerie number about the theme of war and conflict. The song becomes very intense and dramatic as Phil\\'s voice soars to an incredible climax. I love how the song itself merges into a parade of Irish bagpipes and parade drums to round out the track. \"Heat On The Street\" is a really fun and powerful pop classic rocker that is without a doubt 100 percent Phil.In terms of socially-conscious songwriting, the nearly 9 minute epic track entitled \"Colours\" is arguably among some of the greatest socially conscious tracks ever written by anyone. I would almost go far as to say that it\\'s even more powerful than a lot of what Janet\\'s Rhythm Nation brings out and rivals the power of anything on Peter Gabriel\\'s \"Melting Face\" album from nine years before then. The first 2 and a half minutes of this song are very eerie and having a very soft but cold winter melody and blasts into a beautiful climax as Phil asks who do you blame \"Tell me what can you say! Tell me what do you blame!\". Those are among some of the most powerful lyrics of my childhood. The first chapter in the track echoes away into a mechanical sounding industrial rhythm and an African Xylophone with an ominous undertone like a storm brewing overhead before bouncing back as a face-paced pop/rock song with a far more upbeat tone and the return of the Phoenix Horns to create one of the greatest tracks that I\\'ve ever heard from Phil. I would even go far enough to say that this is almost as progressive as anything that he did with Genesis! Awesome stuff I tell you.This album isn\\'t all excessively serious and bleak though. That wouldn\\'t be until \"Both Sides\" came along four years later. \"Hang on Long Enough\" is pure fun and highly energetic. \"Something Happened on the Way To Happen\" is a fun, and rocking classic and one of the best on this album and is almost as happy, and upbeat as almost anything from \"No Jacket Required\". The same is true with the semi-ballad \"All of My Life\" which is among the few songs where a saxophone is present. \"Saturday Night Sunday Morning\" is a brief interlude with really fast placed drumming and those all too familiar Phoenix Horns and the song slows down into a groovy bluesy track for the remaining 50 seconds. \"Do You Remember\" is classic Phil and a great classic ballad that unfortunately wasn\\'t included on his \"Hits\" collection. Ironically while it\\'s definitely a very good song, it\\'s probably my least favorite song but even then it\\'s still very good.\"Father Son\" is one of my favorite non-single ballads ever by Phil Collins having a very warm and sweet and hopeful tone to it and the song becomes hauntingly beautiful towards the last minute of the song with the sparkling keyboard effects. The album closes with the powerful anthem entitled \"Find a Way To Your Heart\". The song begins with a Space Age rock intro, becomes a haunting ambient pop classic with intense and frantic rhythm and finally becomes a high energy pop classic with a lot of those trademark Phoenix Horns and a highly upbeat mood. Finally the song fades back into the haunting Space Age sounding guitar effects which rounds out this amazing musical journey.\"Another Day In Paradise\" is the best song on this album and was my childhood favorite song. This song really changed my view on things just out of it\\'s beautiful melody and Phil\\'s incredible singing and lyrics. While just the dark twilight melody was what really turned me onto this song back when I was just a child when it was new, this has now become an absolutely life-changing track because it was one of the first songs that ever actually grabbed my attention and turned me into a music lover from there onwards. The dark and industrial intro gives away to the unforgettable sound that we have never forgotten ever since. The song is a vivid and dark insight into the plight of a homeless human being and it\\'s lyrics paint the picture from both the homeless person\\'s perspective as well as a bystander\\'s point of view.As I look back on it now, the fact that this song actually made it to number one and and stayed there for several weeks from Christmas of 1989 and into January of 1990 and even unfortunately prevented Janet\\'s \"Rhythm Nation\" from making the top spot for a while (No pun intended, that track also deserved to be number one as well) is without a doubt one of the best music chart moments in history. That this track also won a Grammy is among the best things to me anyways to happen to music. This song got the justice and praise that it deserved and that it\\'s still a hugely popular track today is testament to the longevity and power of this amazing classic. I literally broke down in tears of joy after I saw him perform it live in concert. How someone could write a song so powerful and lasting I don\\'t know but Phil did it!I highly recommend all of his solo albums including his most recent one \"Testify\" but put his 1989 magnum-opus \"But Seriously\" at the top of your list. This album was brilliant back when it was released and more than 15 years onwards it is an absolute classic today that doesn\\'t sound the slightest bit dated even when placed against most newer releases of the 2000s. Even a good amount of music released in 1999 sounds more dated than this.

This incredible follow-up to the great But Seriously finds Phil Collins going deeply personal on this CD and in much darker territory. Both Sides is virtually opposite to the feel-good upbeat feel of Both Sides and much less socially conscious than But Seriously. Unfortunately this CD found one of my favorite artists commercial success slumping. Both Sides is a vastly underrated masterpiece from the meistro of the drums. The best songs on this CD are the mournfully nostalgic Can't Turn Back The Years, the heartwarming Everyday(My favorite track on this CD), the bitter I've Forgotten Everything, the saddening minor note Can't Find My Way the more upbeat Survivors, and the We Fly So Close(Very reminiscent of In The Air Tonight).The lyrics are very deep and powerful and express strong feeling but it's mainly the dark melodies that express the majority of the mood of this album. Both Sides is so wonderfully crafted that I regret buy this album used because buying a new copy of Both Sides would've added to record sales. That's how good Both Sides really is. Plus another thing is that Phil played all of the instruments when recording this album and that really makes this album one of his most talented works to date. If you're looking for the poppish fun of Sussudio, Two Hearts or Don't Lost My Number steer clear of Both Sides because this powerful CD is almost completely opposite to the excellent No Jacket Required. The happier songs on Both Sides are more melancholy than even Long Way To Go off No Jacket Required. It's kind of odd that Phil suddenly took a 180 degree turn into much more upbeat territory with the incredibly underrated 1996 follow-up Dance Into The Light which probably is a close cousin to No Jacket Required.\", 'overall': 5.0, 'summary': 'Like US was to Peter Gabriel, Both Sides is to Phil Collins', 'unixReviewTime': 1028678400, 'reviewTime': '08 7, 2002'}, {'reviewerID': 'A3EJYJC25OJVKK', 'asin': 'B000002JB3', 'reviewerName': 'Distant Voyageur \"Nicholas Computer\"', 'helpful': [7, 8], 'reviewText': \"Phil Collins took a daring new turn in his music with this excellent but sadly underrated masterpiece. The music on here is less ambient, more optimistic and generally more upbeat than the dark depressing masterpiece Both Sides.

It's a great song that you should give a listen to. That's What You Said is a cool with a more acoustic sound. Lorenzo is a beatiful song with some African drums combined with African flutes and phat beats. It's one of my favorites on this CD. Just Another Story is a laid back song with a light beat and a high pitched trumpet like the kind that Miles Davis played. It's kind of a song that I would play when walking down a city street approaching downtown. Love Police is a great simple song. It's a little hard to describe exaclty how it sounds like but it's a must hear. Wear My Hat is the fastest song on this CD. It's very tropical sounding with some Jamaican drums and some Big Band horns. It's In Your Eyes is an OK song. I'm not very moved by this one. Probably one of the most boring tracks Phil has ever written. It's not bad but average. Oughta Know by now brings back the Phil that we know from the But Seriously days with the thundering beats and the great guitar playing. It sounds kinda like I Wish It Would Rain Down but not quite as 'BIG' sounding. Take Me Down is a very groovy song with a strong big band sound. I play this one alot. It's one of my favorites on this CD. The Same is a haunting song with a dark sound kind of like Father To Son from But Seriously. I love how the last five seconds fades out into the next song. River So Wide is the winner on this CD. It a very intense song with thundering drums and heavy guitars that make the perfect song for a jungle action movie. No Matter is acoustic song similar to It's In Your Eyes but better. Not my favorite but good. The Times They Are A Changing is a great closer to this CD. Its a very well done cover version of the 1963 version done by Bob Dylan. The beats are phat.This CD will have to grow on you but in the end you'll love it. I do. I listen to this one a lot.

Lie To Me is an amazing song that I listen to many times without tiring. The dark melody, the sad sound to it is a treat for my ears. People Are People is a fabolous song with phat beats, killer bass lines and a sort of industrial feel. This song is about all people of all religions, races, etc. to get along regardless of their differences. This song has a great message.

Stories Of Old is another cool song but nto as great as the next one. This song is rather poppy. Somebody is a very sad piano ballad with simply pianos and Martin Gore on vocals. This song is truly a gem on this CD. Master And Servant stirred some controversy back during it's heyday. It's a hard-edged song with a strong industrial feel. This song from what I guess talks about S&amp;M. This is my second favorite. If You Want is my favorite off SGR. It starts off as a creepy electronic song with creepy keyboards and with no drums for the first minute. At 1:30 the drums starts and the song becomes an industrial new wave dance number. Blasphemous Rumours is the one that caused controversy back in 1984. It's a very depressing song about religous doubt and suicide.

The sheer number of singers and other stars who came aboard for this project is impressive! Starring a huge cast of old-time singers some of whom have sadly since passed away, rappers, and then yet-to-be pop stars this incredible masterpiece is without a doubt a contender for being one of the smartest, most creative, and energetic albums anyone has ever put out.  While I don\\'t want to sound too biased with this review but \"Back On The Block\" is my favorite African-American music album of all time.  .The party begins with a marvelous rap interlude entitled \"Prologue (20\\'s rap scene/ Quincy\\'s Rap) which is a fun and energetic warm-up track featuring a wonderful rap dialogue that is really a lot of fun and highly joyous to listen. The title begins with a industrial metallic drum intro similar to that of the title track of Janet Jackson\\'s dynamite \"Rhythm Nation\" and becomes a marvelous and energetic blend of rap, hip-hop with a New Jack Swing Spice. \"I Don\\'t Go For That\" is similar to the previous and with a stadium-like New Jack Swing anthem with a fun Manhattan nighttime city feel. \"I Don\\'t Go For That\" is a wonderful New Jack Swing classic with a highly danceable beat, wonderful melody.\"The Verb To Be\" is a really humorous interlude with oddly amplified voice effects and really funny lines. The laughing voices merge into the track \"We Be Doing\\' It\". For all of the humor of \"Verb\" it perfect blends into the hip-hop rhythm and the song has a wonderful mix of R&B;, blues, and dance all meshed together. If you\\'re looking for great hip-hop music and for a testament for 1988-1991 being the Golden Era of this once-great genre, look no further. \"The Place You Find Love\" is one of my absolute favorite tracks on this album. It starts with a dramatic echoing Gospel voice and becomes a powerful Gospel anthem for the ages. The vocals by whoever is singing are absolutely incredible and do wonders for this track.The next two-some track combo \"Jazz Corner of the World\" and \"Birdland\" to me are the apex of this album. \"Jazz Corner\" has a really perky Brazilian percussion and has a really cool hip rap verse. The groove of \"Jazz Corner\" perfectly merges into my absolute favorite song on this album \"Birdland\". This is without a doubt the best song Quincy has ever recorded and quite likely a candidate for the best cover-song I\\'ve ever listened to. With amazing bass lines and energetic trumpet horns similar from what one would hear from Phil Collins, the beat is just amazing and the song has a really awesome groove unrivalled by few other songs from 1989. \"Septembro\" is a sultry soulful instrumental jazz song with really unique chord shift and wonderful wordless vocals.\"One Man Woman\" is a great and energetic dance song with a strong New Jack Swing style. \"Tomorrow\" is sheer and utter beauty featuring a barely teenaged then future-superstar Tevin Campbell singing on vocals and childrens choir. The song has a really positive, cheerful, and uplifting vibe to it.The final track Secret Garden is one of the sexiest soul ballads of all time with a very Quiet Storm mood and featuring guest vocals from the late R&B; crooner Barry White (I cried at the news of his passing) the create a beautiful nighttime closer to this illustrious masterpiece of an album.This album is just about on the border of being utmost perfection.

It\\'s really a pity that this is Madonna\\'s last great album to date. \"Music\" is enjoyable but nothing that sticks in your head and \"American Life\" was an epic dissapointment. I can still remember the spooked feelings that I got when the whispering ambiences of \"Substitute For Love\" came out of my speakers during that dark, damp evening of March of 1998 when I bought this album. Even now, six full years removed from when first hearing it, SFL still gives me the most euphoric chills I\\'ve ever experienced in music. Everything afterwards is a long perpetual epic adventure through innovative techno, New Age, and rock dance music but this is no generic dance record by any stretch of the imagination. Not a chance. \"Ray of Light\" is light years beyond other dance music of it\\'s time.\"Frozen\" was a well-deserved classic that still brings chills to me when listening to it. It has a very dramatic and very melencholy mood to it and the video that accompanied it was absolutely stunning. Some may look at me strange but I kind of think of this song as the antithesis of \"Open Your Heart\". Where as OYH is a fun and sunny 1980s dance classic, \"Frozen\" is a very dark and rainy evening song with a very haunting orchestral style. Looking back on it now, amidst the disappointing music she\\'s put out over the past year, \"Frozen\" is now one of my favorite charting singles of all time of her\\'s. My favorite track on this entire album though is track 5, \"Skin\". Whoa! This song back in early 1998, scared the daylights out of me. It starts with a very murky electronic intro, dissolves into ghostly whispers and finally becomes a pulsating, intense, and eerie dance song that really spooked me, in a great way, at it\\'s incredibly eerie atmosphere.As of writing this review, this album remains unrivalled by anything Madonna has put out ever since, and in fact, I would even go as to say that there has yet to come an album that brings the thrills that \"Ray of Light\" did in early 1998. If you had to pick three Madonna albums, this is one of them. The others would be \"EROTICA\" and \"Like A Prayer\". Go for the rest if you like but these three albums in my opinion showcased the major pinnacles Madonna reached over the past 20 years and perhaps sometime in the near future she may wow us again just like she did with this album back during 1998-1999. I generally find it hard to really give a good opinion on it but I feel so sorry for those who missed this really period from early 1998-through the middle of 1999.I could listen to this album in the year 2018, 20 years after being released, and it wouldn\\'t sound a day out of place. If you like this one, then I would recommend \"Mezzanine\" by Massive Attack. With these two, you will experience an adventure like nothing before.

I love the line &quot;the sun doesnt always shine, the sky isn't always blue&quot;. The song begins as a minor note and morphs into a major note at the 3 minute mark. This is probably the brightest song on the album but still dark compared to almost any other dance album. Real McCoys debut Another Night has a similar mood to this CD although poppier. The other is Lanscape with a heavy beat and a very moody atmosphere. In My Dreams is a very brooding song with echoing beats and and very big ambient atmosphere like an approaching storm.The original version of Children(Track 10) I tend to enjoy with it's echoing acoustic guitars and lighter flatter beat more than the club version.Despite the cons of this CD, it still gets a five star mainly because of it's sheer magic, and emotional charachteristic unlike so much of todays annoying dance music. It's far above anything most dance artists could do.I say go and get this CD.It only gets better with the incredible follow-up 23 am, my favorite trance CD to date.\", 'overall': 5.0, 'summary': 'One of the best dance CDs I,ve ever owned', 'unixReviewTime': 1017532800, 'reviewTime': '03 31, 2002'}, {'reviewerID': 'A3EJYJC25OJVKK', 'asin': 'B000002WA5', 'reviewerName': 'Distant Voyageur \"Nicholas Computer\"', 'helpful': [2, 3], 'reviewText': 'Sure \"The Way It Is\" is a classic and his highest selling album to date but in my opinion, it is his sophomore effort perfectly entitled \"Scenes From The Southside\" that holds the crown as my favorite album that Bruce Hornsby has ever released, solo or with his band The Range.

Only Peter Gabriel in my opinion rivals Phil. This fantastic collection of his music from 1981-1998 is what I said 'FANTASTIC!'. It's a great collection of most of Phils biggest hits from the ominous thundering drums of the angry bad blood vibe of 'In The Air Tonight' to the Prince 1999-esque 'Sussudio' to the ever so timeless Another Day In Paradise(One of my childhood favorites). This CD even has cuts from his more obscure albums like 1993 incredibly underrated Both Sides and 1996s Dance Into The Light also vastly underrated. This CD could've included Do You Remember, I Missed Again &amp; Father To Son and it could've included more songs from the Both Sides and Dance Into The Light albums and even some more new songs and made this collection a double album but the exclusions of these songs is made up for by the inclusions of his hit songs from soundtracks that are long out of print. Examples of these are the upbeat Two Hearts, Easy Lover &amp; the intimate and powerful Against All Odds which is one of Phils most beautiful ballads to date. This CD also has a new song called True Colors. True Colors was originally done by Cindi Lauper in 1986 which was a hit. While I like the original Phil Collins improves it with his own spin to it by even adding some Celtic Uillian pipes for an even better suprise. I hope Phil adds some more worldly sounds in his music just like Peter Gabriel does. Dance Into The Light was a great first step in my opinion. Even then Phil will always remain one of my favorites. I personally think this CD was very well put together and is a worthy collection for the fanbase. Even if it excludes some of Phils hits this CD has songs from 80s soundtracks that have been long out of print. This CD is definately a must.

Musically, this CD is much darker than anything that he had done before and Sting dives into a more New Agey electronic trance sound but at the same time maintaining his trademark style and the results are absolutely amazing!And deservedly so, this also put Sting back onto the pop charts with his biggest hit single in many years at this point in his career &quot;Desert Rose&quot; which is just stunningly beautiful. The other one is my favorite song of his ever which is the title track to this album.However another favorite song however is track 8 &quot;Fill Her Up&quot;. I could almost label this as like a mini-progressive pop epic because it's almost like three songs in one. It starts off being a really funny humorous country song but it morphs into radically different style and becomes a Gospel-oriented epic before finally morphing down into a jazz-oriented song.

It was almost four years between the dynamite Orblivion and Cydonia. I kinda feel a bit disspointed. The sound isn't too innovative, and some trackon here are not very good.However I would consider this CD good and I find it to be a little groundbreaking because it brings in real singing on a few songs instead of vocal or voice samples like on older Orb records. Once More is probably the most mainstream song The Orb have ever composed. While it might sound a little out of place with most older Orb material it is one of the best songs on the album. I find Once More to be their sunniest songs in years probably since Little Fluffy Clouds. Ghostdancing, Centuries, and Plum Island are the others that have vocals. The singer who sings on those songs sounds similar to Bjork.Promis, Turn It Down, Hamlet Of Kings are your typical Orb instrumentals. I enjoy each of the songs I mentioned so far.On the flip side I don't really care for Thursdays Keeper because it sounds kind of cheap and thrown together. The 11 minute megawork Terminus is an attempt to create another ambient chill-out track. Unfortunately Terminus drags on comes off as downright boring, mediocre and uncreative by Orb standards. Remember the haunting Blue Room with the dark powerful ambience with the air raid sirens and morhping into a funky dance track? There is nothing like that on Terminus. Not that Terminus is  terrible, it's just boring and doesn't grab you in any way like air raid siren in the beginning of Blue Room or the heavy dance beats of the title track of U.F.

Even the during that period where grunge cut both ways for me, I first heard \"Possession\" and the song really stood out against almost everything else from that time and made me a fan of hers for good.This newest album is also calmer and much more on the sad side considering that the two major emotional events that inspired this album almost like the sadness of the darkening daylight hours of approaching winter but also positive like the returning warmth of the approaching spring.

However their sophomore release entitled \"Sweet Dreams (Are Made of This)\" was the album that thrusted them into international success with the famous classic \"Sweet Dreams are Made of This\". Although not the first album I\\'ve owned by them (Savage was the first CD I bought), it stands out in my opinion because of it\\'s bizarre character throughout the album. The original version of \"Sweet Dreams\" as well as it\\'s virtual twin album \"Touch\" suffered tremendously from the really poor volume quality details. Both of these albums were recorded on low-tech equipment and \"Sweet Dreams\" was recorded from September to November of 1982 and released in January of 1983. The 2005 deluxe edition though I feel really improves the sound quality in a way that I never would\\'ve thought possible. While the album was definitely showing it\\'s age, the improved remastering makes it almost like as if a towel was lifted off the stereo speakers and makes a Stone Age sounding record sound brand new all over again!No one can forget the experimental nature of its title track with it\\'s famous video with Annie Lennox her gender-bending fashion style. The song itself too is awesome with it\\'s incredible keyboard arrangements, innovative pre-techno drum beat as well as it\\'s dramatic, dark melody. But other songs that stand out are the opening track \"Love Is A Stranger\", the menacing nature of \"I Could Give You An Angel\" and the R&B;/ New Wave hybrid song that is \"This Is The House\" which combines the best of 1970s funk guitars with the electronic 80s New Wave sounds to create a real classic. For all the glory of the title track, it pales in comparison to what I consider the most transcendent track on here that closed out the older edition of this album entitled \"This City Never Sleeps\". As the previous songs in general have a more or less sunny afternoon but austere industrial atmosphere, this song has a much mellower and much darker but more pleasant evening dark mood compared to the rest of this album. The song begins with the sound of underground subway trains and becomes a very eerie, late night urban song with an ambient sound and incredible vocals by Annie. The strange melody of the song as well as the distant light guitar riffs that build in the background and increase into the foreground in sound is just amazing. The combination of this and the subway train track sound effects give the song among the best urban atmospheres of many early 1980s songs. At more than six minutes in length, \"This City Never Sleeps\" allows for a great amount of enjoyment that would not be possible had it been half as long. Out of all the tracks on this album, TCNS is without a doubt the best song on here, both on the old and remastered editions. As I listen to it, I am just impressed at how well it\\'s held up over the years since it was recorded! Especially by 1983 standards, \"This City Never Sleeps\" is a year ahead of it\\'s time and even ahead of songs that they did in the years the followed. Even songs that I did not mention are great as well.The bonus tracks are mostly decent and actually add some flavor to the remastered edition that makes it much more adventurous than the old version was. Although most of them certainly are odd electronic New Wave noodlings that were odd enough to just stay in the b-side category, the six bonus tracks though are still a lot of fun to listen to even if their quality is variable. \"Home Is Where The Heart\" is one of the strangest songs I\\'ve ever heard from this duo. Monkey Monkey\" and \"Baby\\'s Gone Blue\" are decent experimental tracks but don\\'t rank up to the rest but are still enjoyable to a degree. Included are two remixes done in 1991, one of is \"Sweet Dreams\" as well as \"Love is a Stranger\" both of which I feel do a wonderful job of giving them a whole different character. The Hot Remix of \"Sweet Dreams\" is darker, much heavier in mood and has a much heavier techno-drum beat, new keyboard parts as well as some haunting voice keyboard ambience to give the song a much stormier, more intense feel almost totally different from the original version. The Coldcut Remix of \"Love Is A Stranger\" is over 7 minutes long and has a much more of a sound that blends old school hip-hop and electronica keyboards to build the melody. Some of the `slushy\\' electronic sound effects as well as the amplified voice effects give the song a spookier sound but still a very flamboyant and sophisticated style to the point that had it not been for Annie\\'s lyrics being song, would\\'ve sounded almost like a totally different song altogether. Some have criticized the inclusion of these two songs but I have to digress. I have to say that both \"Sweet Dreams\" and \"Love is a Stranger\" were redone incredibly well.The final track called \"Satellite of Love\" was previously unreleased until now and is now available for future generations to enjoy. The song sounds extremely dated, even by 1983 standards but is still enjoyable especially in the second half of the track. It closes this expanded edition of \"Sweet Dreams\".I\\'ve always had an incredible admiration of Annie\\'s lyric songwriting as well as her icy strength throughout her music career both with her partner Dave Steward as the Eurythmics and as a solo artist from \"Diva\" onwards. The remastered edition of \"Sweet Dreams\" is highly recommended even if you\\'ve had the original version for many years. It\\'s that great! I never could\\'ve imagined the day that their wonderful albums would all get the treatment they deserved and \"Sweet Dreams\" in my opinion benefited the most from this!

This is arguably my favorite intro track since the intro to MCMXC a lifetime ago. From her though the album starts to get somewhat repetitive with most of the songs having a similar style with occassional breaks. \"Invisible Love\" though has such a beautiful intro with 12-string guitars meshed with beuatiful keyboard sounds before it becomes a slower-paced dance-oriented track.

The greatest thing about that release is that it succeeded without relying on any particular pop formula. Any release that includes the anthemic &quot;Everybody Wants to Rule the World&quot; and the jazzy &quot;I Believe,&quot; just to name a couple, shows that these guys were going to be much more than a passing trend. Although it took many aborted tries, the duo's third release &quot;The Seeds of Love&quot; was another smash and introduced the world to Oleta Adams and highlighted the duo's softer side. After again struggling to produce their fourth album, Curt Smith wound up leaving the group. Roland Orzabal retained the rights to the duo's name and released &quot;Elemental&quot; as a Tears for Fears product.Many critics and some fans did not  like &quot;Elemental&quot; (although thankfully not most Amazoners), but although it sold well, many found it to be less compelling their any of their first three releases. I only agree to a degree, as &quot;Elemental&quot; may not a 5-star release (the rating that I give to Tear for Fear's first three releases), it easily earns 4 stars on the strength of the first 4 songs (the powerful and addictive &quot;Elemental,&quot; the melodic and catchy &quot;Cold,&quot; &quot;Break It Down Again&quot; which may be THE song that captures the essence of their first three releases, and the jazzy &quot;Mr. Pessimist&quot;). I love &quot;Gas Giants&quot; and all the other songs, with the possible exception of &quot;Power.&quot;In a nutshell, if you are a fan of Tears for Fears, your collection should not overlook this release. If you are not a hardcore fan, you might be better off going for one of their greatest hits compilations as they flow quite well. So 4 starts it is and be on the lookout for &quot;Everybody Loves a Happy Ending,&quot; as it represents Curt's return to the band, but as is always the case with this group something gets in their way of getting their music out there. It appears that the issue is now label-related as Arista (the duo's new US label) changed regimes before the CD was scheduled to come out in mid 2004 and it seems like everything in the pipeline is being questioned by the new regime.

It was remastered in 2001 with additional cuts as well as US mixes of 2 hit singles, the massive hit Shout as well as the lesser ranking Mothers Talk.This is a hard review as the original release was perfect so who could argue with a decent remastering job? Especially is you are replacing a cassette or a CD purchased in the 1980a that has probably seen better days. So if either of the above apply, I would do it without a doubt. If you are not interested in their individual releases, and want their greatest hits you should stick to Shout: The Very Best Of Tears For Fears, which was also released in 2001My main (yet workable) qualm with this remastered release is the that it highlights that it has bonus tracks (which hard-core fans usually year for in principle), and with the exception of being able to hear the differences between the album versus US single cuts of Shout and Mothers talk, all the other bonus cuts make it clear that they should have remained in the vaults.I wish that had included some worthy B-sides, dance/extended remixes, as they did in ther brilliant rerelease of The Hurting, instead of what sound like working sessions/dubs of the main body of the release. The liner notes highlight that some did not think that the release, which only had 8 cuts did not constitute a full album and that those dissenters would be pleased to know that this release now had double the number of cuts.My response to those comments are as follows:To the critics: 8 great cuts beat some of the navel gazing artists who max. out a CDs running time just to give the impession that more means better, or even wrose put out 2 CD releases without any merit.To the writer of the liner notes and team behind this release. First, 15 cuts is less than 16 so while nit picking the number of cuts has not been doubled. The real problem, as highlighted above is that cuts 9-13 are true fillers.Final thoughts: I purchased this CD and made my own 5 star mix by recording the 8 original cuts (now remastered) and added cuts 14 and 15. The extraction of cuts 9-13 is essential unless you want to keep pressing for next song.I am a huge TFT fan and would recommend that any fan buy this collection, as long as they are not doing so due to the belief (those marketing knuckle heads) that they will be getting some unreleased gems. If money is tight and you already have the original CD, stick with that and save your money to consider purchashing their Ultimate Collection 3 CD release (2 CDs plus !

Through the extensive liner notes and reviews by other Amazon.com reviewers I now understand that the producers' work was handed to a seasoned Motown veteran named Russ Terrana who cut down on the Chic touches and made it more mainstream (whatever that is). Having said that, a side to side comparison is almost a draw as there are merits to both; notwithstanding, I my clear preference goes to the original Chic-produced songs as it does not push Diana back into the mix a some suggest, but rather it has her sounding more relaxed and free-flowing than ever. The Chic touch does not make it a &quot;Chic&quot; release, fronted by Diana Ross, as it's a collaboration just like any other. No one ever says that &quot;The Boss&quot; release is as an &quot;Ashford &amp; Simpson&quot; release fronted by Diana Ross, but their influence is in the mix.Competing versions aside, the back to back releases of &quot;The Boss&quot; and &quot;diana&quot; are in my opinion on top of the list for Diana's best solo work. A case can be made for either but &quot;diana&quot; wins on its strong singles, newly released original versions, and non-singles that get more infectous every time that you hear them. I've become absolutely hooked &quot;Have Fun (Again),&quot; as the arragements/choruses are addictive. Also, the really cool sounds integrated into &quot;Friend To Friend&quot; have brought that song an underlying funkiness to its already great version. And there is a tropical touch added to &quot;My Old Piano&quot; that sends the song to a place that it never reached. This 2003 remastered 2 CD collection is broken down as follows:Disc 1 includes the retouched/released song set and it is followed by the original/previously unreleased song set. So whatever your preference it's a win/win. Disc 2, titled &quot;Dance&quot; is a hodgepodge of remixes, unreleased songs, extended versions, and a even a Supremes medley that for the most part are not &quot;essential&quot; BUT is a must if, like me, you love the song &quot;Love Hangover&quot;, as the extended alternative 10 minute mix is the best version that I've ever heard of that song. Remixes are a hit/miss (generally miss) as they are either an extended version that does not have any value added or re-workings, which generally push the singer to the back with whatever sound is club-worthy at any given moment. Some of these songs never end. This second CD is also a must have for me as it has an amazing version that seamlessly combines &quot;No One Gets The Price/The Boss&quot; into something that is greater than the sum of its already great parts. There a couple of songs that I had not heard off which also registered quite nicely.Like most things, all is not perfect even in this release. The aforementioned Supremes medley is truly awful and there are about 5 others in the 2nd CD that are filler. Although this release easily earns its 5 stars simply for its 1st CD as it's rather brave for a record company to risk alienating those hard-core fans who probably bought the: original LP, first-released CD, the 1999 remastered CD, and now have this to consider. If enough people wind up championing the original Chic versions, there may be an uprising of sorts. But then what do I know. One huge issue that I have with the &quot;Deluxe Edition Releases&quot; is their high price. In almost no case do two CDs warrant such a high listing price (up to $29.99 in most stores) and it seems like this pricing will be a trend as many releases are getting the &quot;Deluxe Edition&quot; treatment. The worst example is one of my favorites, which is &quot;Grease&quot;, as the &quot;Deluxe Edition&quot; is the only remastered version to be released since the original analogue and although it sounds better than ever, the second CD has several &quot;sing-a-long versions&quot; that are simply due to lacking material, also retailing for up to $29.99.Notwithstanding pricing issues, &quot;diana&quot; is one THE great releases and listening to the Chic original versions, I can't believe that I had not before put this release among my all-time favorites.

I purchased it when it initially came out and liked it a lot, but it's one of those CD's that gets better with each listen so I wanted to let those people who love pop in it's purest form to give this a try. Daniel Bedingfield has put together a great collection of songs (a little of everything) and it all works so well that the singles keep coming at the listener and they could all be potential singles. The problem with Daniel is that he is difficult to market as his songs are pure pop mugic that will please both the TRL crowd and older listeners who tend to have a bias against what they may incorrectly perceive a kiddie-pop.But no review of this release can be comprehensive if it does not address the warmth of Bedingfield's voice. Without the histrionics of some of his counterparts, he does manage to leave a strong impression by feeling, not just hitting (or doing vocal gymnastics) the highs and lows.I particularly like the flow of the release and was surprised that it was self-produced. What I find astonishing is that one can clearly see the influence of US pop and R&B; music on this release, but instead of being a knock-off, Bedingfield seems to surpass all his influences.Among my favorites:Gotta Get Thru ThisIf You're Not the OneI Can't Read YouFridayJames Dean (I Wanna Know)GirlfriendHonest QuestionI think that you get the point.

And I am sure that there are more to come.This 2 CD set is well priced and there is a plethora of goodies to be found in the inserts.

However, I could have done without the two selections from &quot;Songs From The West Coast&quot; as they sound out of place to me and although I think that the duet with Leann Rimes is nice, to ignore the aforementioned and many others makes me give this 4 stars instead of 5. Elton John the artist gets a 5, especially if you'd had the chance to see him in concert at almost anytime during his career.Side bar: Although this does not affect my rating the set also includes an extra compact disc that does nothing for me so I just dicarded it. I wish that instead of &quot;Candle In The Wind (Live)&quot; and &quot;Don't Let The Sun Go Down on Me&quot; (With George Michael) and others, this extra CD would have gone into the catalogue to find loved songs that may not have been conventional hits.

Sam Cooke possessed the sweetest voice in soul, and his elegant vocal style inspired almost every singer worth his nickle. He was also a terrific songwriter, and the string of hits created prior to his death in 1964 was unrivaled.I can hear this CD non-stop for days, weeks,.... It should be mandatory for all singers to listen to this release as it showcases a singer whose delivery was so elegant and did not have to go through vocal gymnastics to bring it home. It did not matter whether he was singing traditional pop, soul, gospel, or (you name it), as it all came back to Sam's voice and elegant delivery.This collection has all the songs, including the indispensible &quot;A Change Is Gonna Come&quot;. Sam's version continues to be THE definitive version and any collection that overlooks it should be banned. As you can imagine I give this my highest recommendation. Also worth noting this release has been remastered to blow away all previous efforts and unlike the previous single CD greatest hits collection, this one has an informative insert that tells us a little bit about the history of the songs.NOTE: This state-of-the-art digital audio release titled is a magical 31-track greatest hits release that has been replaced the already amazing &quot;The Man And His Music,&quot; a 28 greatest hits collection released in the 1980s. There is one downside to the CD as it is a hybrid with SACD capability, so that it will play in regular CD players and those with the SADC technology. The only problem lies in that, like other hybrid SACDs you cannot make a personal copy or grab any of the songs to put in a personal mix. For me that is a huge downside as I make lots of mixes to reflect different moods and favorite all time songs; notwithstanding if you just plan on listening to it and don't mind that you won't be able to pick and choose songs to make a mix, there is no better choice than this release.During 2003 and now I've found myself listening to the new releases by Al Green and Ron Isley as well as this release, and I am reminded that new artists have it really hard as Sam and others raised the bar so high and so early that it makes it virtually impossible for anyone to make better sounding music.

I hate to categorize it as &quot;disco&quot; as this release was a stroke of genius as it incorporated so many elements that it does not do it justice to put it in a neat simplistic category. It has now been re-released in a newly remastered/expanded edition and it sounds better than ever and adds some key songs.This release blends rock, disco, ballads and some of the best electronic touches of the era. I have a soft spot for it as the last cut on the original LP was &quot;Sunset People&quot;, a song that in my mind is one of her best and was never released as a single. The throbbing beat is beyond description.Listening to it again so many years after it was first released, only serves to make me love it more as it is clearly THE defining Donna Summer release as it works both as a full concept and its individual parts. It also serves to showcase the full spectrum of Donna's vocal repertoire as there are some who only remember her voice as extended moans from &quot;Love To Love You Baby&quot;. There is nothing wrong with that song (in fact it's soooooo right), but here Donna shows that she can handle just about anything and what amazes me is that she showcases so many facets of her talents yet the whole release is so cohesive. You'd be hard-pressed to find another release that is so satisfying.To top it off this &quot;Deluxe Edition&quot; is worth every cent as it includes a valuable second CD with extended version of this release as well as some of Donna's greatest hits, including the hard to find &quot;Mac Arthur Park Suite&quot; clocking in at 17:35. The packaging tops the original LP release (which is a rarity these days) and it includes lyrics and some great photography, which reminded me of a highly-rated pre-MTV special the ABC aired shortly after this was originally released. The &quot;Bad Girl&quot; put together a show that will forever be etched in my mind.If you are a fan, this is a must, if you are on the fence don't disregard it solely because of erroneous perceptions that Donna Summer is a &quot;disco&quot; creation. She is so much more and this release may be one of the few of the era that you can listen to from beggining to end and it actually sounds like a greatest hits package. It's that good!!!

She deviated from the norm in every respect and wound up making one of the best releases of 1999. Said release was heavily influenced by the genious of The Neptunes, who had not yet reached world domination status. Unfortunately few got to hear it as it took too many risks (which I loved) and did not fit neatly into a simple category. One look at the orange-hair-and-body-paint photo on the cover and you could tell that you were not dealing with your typical songbird. Her follow-up titled \"Wanderland\" was not released in the US and it was not a big loss as it was not as strong as \"Kaleidoscope\" in any respect.Which brings us to \"Tasty\". When I first heard it I thought that is was just OK, but after a few more spins, I can safely say that in its own way it is as strong Kelis\\' debut, as this one has monster hit singles to spare, and greatly benefits from a combination of some of the best producers in the business. Her work with The Neptunes as exemplified with the hit single \"Milkshake\", continues to be a mutually rewarding collaboration, however \"Tasty\" is not solely about The Neptunes as it also has amazing tracks produced by Dallas Austin (the AMAZING opening track titled \"Trick Me\" and the hard-rock edge of \"Keep It Down\"), Andre 3000 (\"Millionaire\" which has quite the Prince feel), the one and only Raphael Saadiq (\"Attention\"), and Rockwilder (\"In Public\").Despite all the new assistance, \"Tasty\" is cohesive and has little filler. In a nutshell, \"Tasty\" strikes the challenging balance of intriguing experimentation and catchy hooks to create one of the most fun records of 2003. I could hear the opening track all day, which is a short soundfest titled \"Introduction\" (no production credits).All is not perfect. There are a few of songs that lack spark such as \"In Public\" and although \"Glow\" starts off like a major winner, the song ultimately falls flat. I also found that \"Sugar Honey Iced Tea\" sounded uninspired; notwithstadning these observations, this is a solid effort that easily earns 4 stars.

Her voice sounds as vibrant as ever, and most of the songs have a joyful feel that's no doubt influenced by the depth of Franklin's faith. She has not sounded this alive in a long time.Although 1998's &quot;A ROSE IS STILL A ROSE&quot; spawned the hit title track produced by Lauryn Hill, Aretha's voice was mixed too far back and the music took center stage. It was not a bad album as it showed how a legendary performer can remain relevant and current without looking desperate; however nothing from that release matches the power of her latest.Here, Aretha is working with the best of the best and they all bring all they have to offer. Her voice is so expressive and the beats are very today. There are a lot of good singers out there, but the Queen is still here, are is Patti Labelle, Chaka Khan, and they are not going anywhere as they have chosen not to remain in mothballs and/or live off residuals.The CD starts with an infectuous single &quot;The Only Thing Missin',&quot; which recalls the feel-good soul of the Staple Singers with a little Prince thrown in. This may be one of the year's greatest singles. &quot;Wonderful&quot; is also amazing.These two are followed by collaborations with the Queen of Hip-Hop Soul, Mary J. Blige. Both tracks (&quot;Holdin' On&quot; and &quot;No Matter&quot;) are off the hook as Mary J. Blige and does not overwhelm Aretha and truly supports and enriches the vocal and musical effort.

Wright recruited key musicians to rekindle the fire of old school soul with an amazing collection of REVAMPED covers that Stone immediately makes her own.I was very skeptical before buying this CD (which by the way is a bargain almost everywhere selling for half the $ of most current releases) as critics tend to want to find the next best thing and hype a good thing into something that it is not. This is not about hype as Stone has a smoky voice that reeks of a  hard-lived life, which only shows that a great interpreter need to not have experienced what she sings about to make you feel it all the way down to your soul.Stone's record company felt that it was best to drop this release of covers over a formal debut album of original material and I could not agree with their decision any more than if I had made it himself. There are many established artists releasing CDs of standards right now (some are great, most are not), but the magic here is in the ecclectic yet cohesive song selection, a voice from the center of the soul, and a production effort that is second to none. Betty Wright has stripped the music in such a way that it seems effortless.In a nutshell, but this release now if you love music over tired hystrionics or every neo-soul artist that is heralded as the next best thing.

Crowe asks Don Henley and Glenn Frey questions about the origin of each and every one of these classics and having them give us a peek into their world.

I really hate these bumper-sticker labels as this is music, and although it is classic, it has pejorative connotations in my head.

It's not perfect by far, as few things are, but she's heading in the right direction and the release grows on you more and more as you let it flow into your consciousness.I love that she's not abandoned her piano arrangements as they are becoming quite an integral part of her work.

It's a mid-tempo song with a great interlude for the spoken word and an amazing outro. Also it just might be the best written song on the CD; &quot;If I Ain't Got You&quot;: Showcases the raspier side of Alicia's voice and she just belts this song in such a way that feels just right.

Norah's second release &quot;Feels Like Home&quot;, certainly avoids the sophomore jinx, but in my opinion it does not pack the quiet punch of her debut.The Good: The CD starts off very well and opens up with the optimistic and lively &quot;Sunrise&quot;, which ups her country element to a higher degree while not neglecting her jazzy piano. &quot;What Am I To You&quot; is my favorite song on this release may be the liveliest that Norah has ever sounded. The musical arrangement is so bluesy (do I dare say Stevie Ray Vaugh-ish) and filled with vocal passion that it seems like a natural expansion to her repertoire. &quot;Those Sweet Words&quot; has Norah sounding as warm and expressive with her elegant piano playing and strings making it one of her finest songs to date. &quot;Carnival Town&quot; has a k.d. land feel (circa her &quot;Ingenue&quot; release) and I mean this as a complement as it's not a knock off of k.d. and simply represents a nice change of pace for Norah. &quot;Creepin' In&quot; showcases Norah's country roots, and while the song is contagious in parts, most of the pleasure of this song comes from Dolly Parton's strong voice and ear for melody. Norah seems somewhat out of her element but the song works because of Dolly. &quot;Humble Me&quot; starts out with Simon and Garfunkel inspired strings and showcases the best of Nora's warm voice. The song is slow but not sleep-inducing as the lyrics are good and her voice is pure Norah with a touch of Bonnie Raitt thrown in for good measure. In both &quot;The Prettiest Thing&quot; and &quot;Don't Miss You At All&quot; has Norah doing what she does best, which is evoking the feeling of a late night session with her rich voice and piano right in front of her.The Not So Good: Both &quot;In The Morning&quot; just falls flat. &quot;Be Here To Love Me&quot; is much better, but the problem in both is not in Norah's voice but songs, especially the former, that do not go anywhere lyrically or musically. &quot;Toes&quot; sounds very soothing, but it lacks anything that registers a pulse and is truly sleep inducing. Not the worst offense in the world, but I am certain that easing one to sleep is Norah's intent as one would miss the rest of the CD. I am not being flip here. &quot;Above Ground&quot; is dead on arrival, despite some great guitar work. &quot;The Long Way Home&quot; sounds (cheap pun intended) like a long and way too slow way home.In a nutshell, this is a good effort that has Norah sounding less jazzy and more country-tinged than in her first release. The problem here lies in that she greatly reduces the noirish tone that works so well for her before and ups the country-twanged elements (both in her voice and arrangements) and she winds up sounding much less convincing than in her first release as there are many singers who have stronger voices (like Bonnie Raitt and Sheryl Crow) that can bring to life the country elements that stagnate quite a few of the songs. To end on a good note, there is rawness in the production that's refreshing as she allows even a few off-key notes to remain. Also, although it may not look like it to some, this release shows some quiet yet notable experimentation. Not all of it works, but it is always refreshing to hear something that was not created for mass market consumption. What the music industry does not get is that the more they focus on talent over veils, they will wind up selling millions along the way as this release already has. It may sound tough to give this only 3 stars, but I still lean towards recommending it for the points highlighted above.\", 'overall': 3.0, 'summary': 'No sophomore jinx...

George obviously had a chip on his shoulder about what constituted critical acclaim, and although he refused to actively participate in the marketing of his second release, he blamed Sony for the lackluster sales when compared to \"Faith.\" He refused to appear on the cover of the release or appear on any promotional material, and although record companies sometimes don\\'t have an artist\\'s best interests in mind, I think that they marketed this release as well as possible and even managed to come up with one of George\\'s best videos by way of  \"Freedom 90.\" Although George was nowhere to be seen on the video, in a way it is the ultimate George Michael video.As many know George lost his long legal battle with Sony and released his third CD (\"Older\") a full 6 years after \"Listen Without Prejudice, Vol. 1.\" \"Older\" continued George\\'s focus on following his less than commercial bliss and although I really liked it, it did not sell as it should have. For reason\\'s unknown to me, we had to wait another 8 years for George to put out \"Patience,\" which is only his fourth release of original songs as a solo artist. It is very much in the vein of \"Older.\" Every single song is produced flawlessly and George continues to prove to be one of his generation\\'s best balladeers.Of course it would be very easy for George to go write some fast paced songs in the vein that made him famous, but it seems like commercial success is less important to him than writing the type of music that seems close to his soul. I for one would like to see both Georges, one singing the heck out of energy-filled songs and the more contemplative one found in \"Older\" and now \"Patience.\"To put my review in perspective, I gave \"Faith\" 5 stars, both \"Listen...\" and \"Older\" earned 4 stars, and I was wavering between 3 and 4 stars for \"Patience,\" but after a few listens it easily earns 4 stars. Don\\'t get me wrong, listening to the release in its entirety is quite a pleasure, but George seems to be set in his ways regarding the type of music that he\\'s is going to release. The first song \"Patience\" is quite beautiful, but sounds just a little too close for comfort to the more effective `Praying For Time.\" \"Amazing\" also reminds me of a previous George song both lyrically and musically, although I like it a lot.Other highlights for me include \"Cars and Trains\" as it perks things up. It\\'s still mid-tempo, but unlike some songs it shows a very strong conviction and the accompaniment makes it stand out from the rest. Although I\\'ve already started my desire for George to do more up-tempo stuff, both \"My Mother Had A Brother\" and \"American Angel\" are gems and unlike much of today\\'s music it tells a story and you really want to listen to the lyrics. Then comes my favorite song \"Flawless (Go To The City)\" a thumping anthem that I would love to have George record more of. He may think that these songs are musical tripe, but putting out good dance music is a talent in as much as his more personal stuff. \"Precious Box\" has an addictive ambient beat that brings something new to the production arsenal. The mid-tempo, Latin-tinged \"Please Send Me Someone (Anselmo\\'s Song)\" is a beautiful song both lyrically and musically. Although \"Freeek! \\'04\" sounds a little too much like \"Freedom 90\" with a little \"I Want Your Sex\" on the side, it\\'s still a fun song. \"Through\" serves as the perfect ender as it reflects that one should always have hope and although it may sound cheesy, I don\\'t think you can hear that enough in these scary times.Although I give this release 4 stars, I wish that George would let loose and release music without feeling that upbeat and beat-driven songs are lesser than the slow and mid-tempo songs he seems to prefer. I am glad that this release is selling very well (currently number 17 on the Amazon.com charts) as I thought that at best it would sell as much as \"Older.\"Not to beat a dead horse here, but it seems like George wants to have it both ways as he wants both critical and commercial success, yet he has not been pushing this release enough and the only two pictures in the entire CD seem to be from the \"Faith\" and \"Older\" periods. The generous inserts have these great pictures of different people, and while may have artistic merit, I wish that George would embrace both his private and public personas as I think that the byproduct would truly free him from any demons that may still haunt him from the overwhelming success and loss of privacy experienced in during the chart life of \"Faith\" and maybe his tenure with Wham!.', 'overall': 4.0, 'summary': \"Very good, but it's time to really shake things up!!

His 1998 collection titled \"Hits\" (well it does get to the point) did a good job of amassing his most successful songs and it was easily a 4 + star effort and I was hungry for more. Unfortunately this collection just does not cut it as it is way too bland and cannot justify a 2 CD set.Although the above may sound harsh, I am not one of those Phil Collins bashers who blast his thin voice and still have not forgiven him for somehow not living up to what they wanted Genesis to be after Peter Gabriel\\'s departure. Phil picked up the torch and brought the band additional commercial appeal and along the way become an unlikely (yet much deserved) solo superstar. I think that several of his releases, especially \"Face Value,\" \"No Jacket Required,\" the amazing yet underperforming \"But Seriously,\" and the grossly ignored \"Both Sides\" are as good as pop gets.While it may have seemed like the perfect idea to release a set of love songs, especially those that were not necessarily hits, the end result lacks variety, poignancy and misses out on what could have been an opportunity to expand on 1998\\'s \"Hits\" by putting his favorites and those that did not make the cut the first time around. Part of Phil\\'s appeal to me is that he knows his strengths and limits and most of the time he hits it out of the ballpark by balancing his work with the right touch of earnestness and, especially in the case of \"No Jacket Required,\" a killer combo of trumpets and a guest list that others would kill for. Here we have back-to-back songs that sound too alike, some overlooked gems, a lot of filler (what\\'s up with 4 songs while overlooking over must have classic \"love songs\" from Phil careers?). Having said that there are a few interesting morsels via previosly an unreleased song, especially the opener on the 1st CD (\"Tearing and Breaking\"), and \"Can\\'t Hold Back The Years,\" which has to be one of Phil\\'s most underrated songs that for some reason did explode onto the charts.In a nutshell if you are a hardcore fan, this release is not going to add anything truly valuable to your collection. Even the inserts are uninspired and stingy considering the price of the release. For the average fan, stick to 1998\\'s \"Hits\" and if you fall somewhere in between you may want to make your own version of \"Hits\" by adding those songs that are must haves for you.

It combined an eclectic yet cohesive song collection with a strong emphasis on real soul. Sure there was a lot of hype about this 16-year old with an old soul whose face was obscured on the CD cover, but she more than lived up to the hype. I was surprised when it sold as well as it did, as putting the music before image for such a young artist usually does not yield strong sales.So now comes \"Mind, Body & Soul, Stone\\'s sophomore release, which consists of original material, versus the potent covers that the brought home with the amazing production of Miss Betty Wright in \"Soul Sessions\". The first question that any fan would ask is if Miss Stone avoided dreaded sophomore curse that haunts too many acts. The answer is simple: Absolutely not! By keeping the same people on board, this release is still deeply rooted in classic soul, but may be even more accessible to younger fans as some songs are more optimistic and a little more radio-ready than those in her already amazing debut. The first 2 songs, \"Right to Be Wrong\" and \"Jet Lag,\" may be new but they sound like classics which would sound perfectly side by side with anything on \"Soul Sessions.\" Next comes \"You Had Me,\" which sounds so contemporary and almost diva-like with a new discoish hook-laden sound that could fill up the dance floor. My current favorite is \"Spoiled\" which is as sexy yet mournful as anything that she\\'s ever sung. The choruses just rock! It\\'s amazing that Joss can have such a HUGE voice yet not grandstand some of her peers. \"Less is More\" has a reggae vibe that spices up the mix. Other standouts include \"Security,\" which slowly builds into an electric guitar and gospel chorus that sounds amazing. The last minute of this song is nirvana!! \"Young At Heart\" has a hip hop vibe that is a refreshing change pace.If you liked Joss Stones\\' debut there is no doubt that you will love this follow-up. I gave the debut 5 stars, and this one almost earns such a high grade. I give it a 4+ as there are too many songs on the CD and a couple of the latter (maybe \"Torn and Tattered,\" \"Killing Time,\" and maybe even \"Sleep Like A Child\") might have made this as taut as the debut.Don\\'t stop your CD after selection 14 as there is a bonus track titled \"Holding Out For A Hero,\"  which starts up much after the last song starts playing. Mild rant: Why do we have to wait over 10 minutes to hear what is one the simplest yet strongest songs on the CD. I understand that some may think that the song maybe not \"fit in\" with the rest as it\\'s just Joss and her piano. I for one would have put it smack in the middle of the CD to give a that change of pace that could have made this release even better than already is.

The band\\'s style (make-up and all), The band\\'s amazing travelogue videos, hit-laden releases, and the fact that the group was loved/worshipped by teenaged girls (a highly maligned group as a whole), certainly did nothing to increase their critical appeal.While the band continued to tour and record in different incarnations, this is the first release that the original 5 have put out since they went their different ways over 20 years ago. While my expectations for this release were not high at all as many reunions are solely based on cashing in on nostalgia, \"Astronaut\" is not only a first-rate release that makes most of what passes as popular music today sound like the work of amateurs, but it has actually made my list of the 10 best releases of 2004. Let\\'s just say that no one is more surprised to write this than I, as some of their recent stuff (with the exception of the majestic \"Ordinary World\") has been good, but not ANYWHERE near the pop masterpiece that these guys have put together.In a nutshell, almost every song on this CD could be released as a single, yet they even work better together. There is not a single dud in the whole release. The \"boys\" seem to have gotten even better through the years as Simon Le Bon\\'s voice has become a much more pliable instrument while the guitar work and drums sound amazing. Fans will be glad to know that the end-product is immediately recognizable, but as good as anything put out during their apex. Some acts make the mistake of adding too many bells and whistles, guest rappers, producers of the moment, to try and be all things to all people. Duran Duran are now elder statesmen of the very best that the 1980\\'s produced and although once considered nothing more than a \"boy-band,\" they are as viable, if not more so, than ever.My favorites include the infectious lead-off single\"(Reach Up for) The Sunrise,\" the retro-sounding yet scorchingly current \"Want You More!,\" and the anthemic \"What Happens Tomorrow\" (this song will stay with you for days). Other stand outs include the acoustic guitar-driven meets electronica \"Astronaut\" and disco-flavored \"Bedroom Toys.\" Although I am currently in below zero cold, listening to \"Taste the Summer\" (which I am doing right now) almost makes me feel like I could be driking exotic drinks in sunny Fiji. OK, I do have a strong imagination, but this music is pure ear candy. If you\\'ve never liked these guys nothing here will change your mind, but for fans and those young enough not to have pre-conceptions of the baggage associated with Duran Duran\\'s heyday, feel free to buy what I think may also become one of your favorite releases.

Their most recent 2005 single is as catchy and vital as their first.One warning, if you are not a fan of synthesizers or the much maligned \"modern rock\", there is nothing in this release that will make you a fan.

It\\'s not hard to see why as that release, as well as this one have sold have. They both really grab you into the songs and don\\'t let you go. If I had to try to explain to someone who never heard this artist why I love Keith\\'s music is that it is intimate, sweeping, catchy, loud and while very much rooted in country it is not a slave to the genre. From an Australian? I keep seeing stereotypes tumbling down...While most reviews for this release have been very positive, I can understand why some, especially long term fans, don\\'t like the direction that Keith\\'s music has taken as he has stepped away from what could be considered the center of country music. Artists as diverse as Wynnona, Faith Hill, k.d. Lang, and possibly the granddaddy of all, Garth Brooks, (just to name a few) have suffered the wrath of some fans for what they see as selling out by becoming more mainstream. What some may not take into account is that most music is a patchwork of sorts that is influenced by music from all over the world and from different genres within each culture. For example, there is no denying that from the very beginning, The Eagles, Jackson Browne and Linda Ronstadt where as rooted in country as in rock. Listen to \"Take It Easy\" if you have any doubts.I don\\'t see this release as anything but something from a really successful artist who is following his own bliss. If you happen to like more traditional country music, nothing here will satisfy that need. Urban\\'s voice does all sorts of things during the release, at times reminding me of Glenn Frye of The Eagles, Kenny Loggins and even the lead singer from the 80\\'s band Toto. This is a complement as it\\'s not derivative.There is a little of everything here. Some of the most touching songs include \"Shine\", \"I Can\\'s Stop Loving You\" (what a song!!!!) and \"Stupid\". There are some killer guitar-driven songs (\"Faster Car\") and some funked out songs that sound entirely like a new genre. \"Tu Compania\" is an example of two-stepping funk that ends with some sexy female voices as the end that not only make it sound fresh, but also timely. \"God Made Woman\" starts out with a choir sound not too dissimilar to the Rolling Stones\\' \"You Can\\'t Get What You Want\", but then steers in a totally different direction. There is even some baroque sounds to give the ear a good workout.I could go on, but you get the point: I like this CD a lot. If you liked \"Be Here\", you may love this CD as it takes what was great about it and mixes it up with sounds that just make you want to listen to each song over and over again. But again, if you don\\'t like your country music to steer away from convention, this release it not for you. I hope that this last part does not offend as I love traditional country music too, but let\\'s not penalize Urban for being who he is or as someone who has abandoned those who first supported him or married a movie star.

Mary J. refused to go along with the plan and pushed hard for the release of \"The Breakthrough\" before any greatest of release. The importance here lies in that Geffen was ready to release this AS IS as a full 1 disc retrospective and as such does not cut it, especially for fans who would want to have her greatest hits/retrospective/best of, in one package.

Her voice, songwritting, production harkons back to the days of a strange in theory but complementary combination of raw emotion and a Motown production. There are some touches of reggae and ska, but at the end of the day it\\'s all about Winehouse\\'s delivery, which some have described as Shirley Bassey meets Billie Holliday. Quite a lot to live up to, and, as is the case with many good releases, the critics go overboard with praise to then knock essentially the same artist to the ground.In my view Amy certainly sounds like a singer from another generation and if you are looking for a pristine perfect pitch voice, she may not be up your alley. Maybe she will is you like a little more than the great pipes of say Christina Aguilera. While I like some of Christina\\'s work, the perfect pitch always benefits when she digs deeper than just hitting notes. Amy sings in a smoky confessional style that leaves her with very little to hide behind. The genius here is that the production manages to sound very, very old school but not in a strictly mimicky fashion, but more as a point of departure.It took me 3 good listens to really fall for this release, which I would give 5 stars to if the US version had (for whatever reason) not included the amazing \"Addicted\" (which closes the UK version) and stuck us with a ridiculous 2 rate remix of the already single worthy \"You Know I am No Good.\" Said song does nothing but add unispired male rap that feels like a crude attempt to include somthing not to lose the \"kids.\" Good music is good music and some of the very best stuff out there does not rely on tired formulas of grabbing any artist (whether a classic like Patty Labelle or someone like Mariah Carey) and trying to \"ghetto\" a release for wider mass appeal. Rap has a place in music and should not be cut and pasted into new or older artists in order to sound contemporary.So listen to songs 1- 10, skip 11, and if we are lucky we\\'ll get to hear \"Addicted\" somewhere down the line. I am amazed that this release is doing as well as it is and it just may be that people want to hear something different priced within reach. Some have taken issue with Amy\\'s first single \"Rehab\" as it seems to make light of a serious alcohol/drug problem that Amy may have. She fired her previous handler who had a role in trying to get her alcohol/drug free and the song could be interpreted as saying that her emotional emancipation came from refusing to be \"controlled.\" I obviously cannot opine on this matter, but that is why in part this release may have a parental guidance sticker on it.

General Hospital with Luke and Laura was the big thing on Tv and so was Dallas and any Sugar Ray  Leonard fight,but in Music there was One Guy who was on the pulse of that year  and his Name was Rick James. Being from Buffalo,New York myself or B-lo as we call it leaves alot of memorys. that summer in taking that our Hometown Boy had truly blown up with a Album that was a Blue-Print for the Future in Funk,Pop,R&B;, and even more so where Rap Music was concearned. the truth is that \"Street Songs\" was the Blue-Print for what Rap Music was to become in terms of talking about issues that not many artists in any style were bold enough to talk about.  Rick James was the People\\'s champion of the Street and for folks who didn\\'t care about Ronald Reagan and his Racist tired ways. Rick James made that album that for the Hood, the Burbs and everywhere else in between,but yet He stayed R&B; and always had that Street Respect.Give it to me baby 1) the horns the story line and the say what  catch phrase were all felt. that is trademark Rick Riff right there. the bass, the Groove and the give it to me.  not many artists would make a song where they admit to being to High to making love to there Ole Lady. Rick allowed himself to be vulnerable and the song caught on big time. there hasn\\'t really been another song that hit like that with that kind of storyline and detail.that song still packs a whole lot of punch and it has been sampled,looped,etc.... so many times since then.Ghettp Life 2) who else was talking about playing frezze tag with Winos? I mean He talked about everything Hood and it kept it real. the Bass groove was slamming. the line one thing about the Ghetto is that it will be there tommorow so people don\\'t you worry is both creative and witty,but at the same time sad. but a reality.Make Love to Me 3) very intoxicating Rhythm and Mellow groove that changes tempo but works. very Jazzesque in terms of the Progression. very smooth.a strong vocal performance by Rick.good strong arrangements.Narada Michael Walden gives a nice touch on the drums.Mr.PoliceMan 4) way before NWA came out with F*** tha police\" Rick James spoke of Racial Profiling and other situations and he kept it real. this Song had a strong Reggae Bob Marley feel to it. Stevie Wonder knocks out the harmonica part. Teena Marie\\'s part works and compliments the song as well.  very honest song. very direct.Super Freak 5) call this the Pay Day Jam. New Wavy with the Funk at the Bottom. twisted lines about the wrong kind of girl to take home to your Mother. but it works. the groove works and the lyrics are funny,but effective. the Longer version is extra Crispy Funky. Rick found a Groove and a song that has been sampled,used,etc... so much it ain\\'t even funny. this is One of those classic Songs that is timeless and will never be forgotten.Fire and Desire 6) Rick James and Teena Marie made a slow Jam classic here and for my money there hasn\\'t been a better duet in the past 25 plus years. the passion, intensity and the overall arrangements and vibe of this song is timeless. Rick gets into Opera on this Classic. the trade-off is classic. this is the kind of song where you break up but you still got strong feelings for your Ex. mos people can relate to that. teena marie around the time was in the Hospital with a 109 degree temperture but she came on down to the studio and knocked this jam out.  Classic and great Musical drama.Call Me Up 7) Pre Cell Phone and early days of the Message box where you\\'d call somebody and leave a Message this song is basically that. now the groove and Rhythm here is on point and also Rick dropped a tight Rap Flow that hasn\\'t always been acknowledged.  the groove itself is very in line with the way Rap Music would go. Rick song the song as if He was Crooning. the range was way up there and he made it work. he nailed it and this song is still cold.i dig the broadway swing of this cut.i dug the latin Percussion break and swinging Horns.tight background vocals.Below the Funk 8)a  Funky Groove Message to the haters directly. nobody else was doing a cut like this back then. a cool ending and on point. this song was loose and the groove is bumping.a cstraight up  Shout out about B-LO.Props to the Stone city band for there Contributions, Lady T. Teena Marie who left a strong impact on this album. Props to Tom Flye.this album Paved the way to keeping the funk but also balancing out the Pop textures which would later take Michael Jackson,Prince, Lionel Richie,Bobby Brown,R.Kelly,Outkast and others across and Beyond into a Wider audience.\"Street Songs\" was that Album that paved the way in the early 80\\'s and it hasn\\'t gotten it\\'s full due. but Rick James was a Musical Genius and he left a strong Impact on the music World and His Music deserves to get the full long overdue it deserves and this Classic Album speaks volumes then as it does now.', 'overall': 5.0, 'summary': 'Classic

A nice chorus too, with coo music.The Grand Finale - features everyone from N.W.A, many people say this is the best song on the album, but for me it's the 2nd best.  All of N.W.A couldnt come better here, all coming with tight verses, especially Eazy-E and The D.O.C (obviously).  The beat here is one of the best on the whole album.

Indeed, as has been said many times before, they did something that had almost never been done.The amazing thing about \"Spiderland\" is the way in which Brian McMahan and David Pajo are able to make their guitars sound so soft and then turn into a \"loudness\" (that\\'s really the wrong word) without the slightest trace of pomp as dominated on the short songs ofTweez. On the opening track \"Breadcrumb Trail\" the band sets the tone with a simple hybrid of folk guitars and almost punkish drums before the electric guitar enters to create an effect that hits one in the heart much more deeply than pompous metal or stadium rock ever could. \"Nosferatu Man\", though danceable, is the closest of \"Spiderland\"\\'s tracks toTweezand does not have the same impact, but with \"Don Aman\" Slint move further-ot than ever before. In the process they create a song in which every note seems to have the emotional effect of an entire song on most other albums. The guitar might seem like Joni Mitchell\\'s\"Coyote\", but it is so much sharper and slower. \"Crystalline\" might be a very apt word given the way in which each note is made for maximum impact.\"Washer\", the longets track on the record, does not have quite the impact of \"Don, Aman\", but the stark instrumentation on most of the track is not only tender and beautiful but truly passionate. \"For Dinner\" is a surprisingly light instrumental piece that does not have the remarkable qualities of \"Spiderland\"\\'s best material, but the closer \"Good Morning Captain\" is really explosive, especially at the end when McMahan screams \"I miss you\" with the kind of helplessness that I myself often feel when in despair.Even if the second and fifth tracks are not up the remarkable standard of innovation and passion of the rest of the album, it is impossible not to give \"Spiderland\" the full five stars.

In doing so, Wonder showed clearly that he was at the time the premier soul musician.Opener \"Too High\" showed considerable melodic growth compared to his previous albums, but it is a touching sad song about the dangers of hard drugs. \"Visions\" is even softer and entirely free of electronics, even featuring an acoustic guitar that showed Wonder must have had some interest in the more experimental music of the time - yet Wonder always gives the song his own spin. \"Living for the City\", the epic third track, is a very deserved masterpiece in which Wonder maintains a remarkably steady crescendo throughout each verse and backs it up with passionate lyrics about the problems of living in the ghetto. The dense groove of \"Living for the City\" is notable in that it never seems overblown even with the bass bass drum throughout the song.\"Golden Lady\", the fourth track, is a beautiful love song, but with \"Higher Ground\" Wonder returns to social commentary with an anthemic, yet delightfully melodic song about a theme he was certainly preoccupied with at the time: the striving for a better world. The groove and Wonder\\'s voice, though, are much tighter than on his previous album, and there is an urgency lacking on parts of \"Talking Book\". \"Jesus Children of America\" continues in a slower vein of social commentary, whilst the closer \"He\\'s Misstra Know-It-All\" is a beautiful song about the dark politics of the Richard Nixon era.

The amazing thing is that from the opening track \"Bop Gun (Endangered Species)\" the band plays even more intensely than they ever did before. its as if far more horns and bass guitars were playing with twice the density of notes, and the really catchy rhythms drive the opening track for the full eight minutes. The ballad \"Wizard of Finance\" returns to more \"classic\" would but its touching beauty means it loses nothing, as does the dreamy, sad \"Placebo Syndrome\" (which I originally heard as \"tropical syndrome\" and laugh at having done so because I hate hot weather) which features some really quiet, beautiful vocals.The real gems here, however, are the two ten-minute epics \"Sir Nose D\\'Void of Funk\" and \"Funkentelechy\". The first of these begins with an eerie announcement and then moves into a long series of familiar childhood tales (\"ba ba black sheep/have you any wool\", \"three blind mice\") that works remarkably well because the voices so often sound like they\\'re from children. \"Funkentelechy\" has fewer synthesisers but the powerful horns and drums that outstrip anything on a previous P-Funk record, together with Clinton\\'s really memorable lyrics and the variety of voices throughout the piece from preachy to mysterious and touching, make this one of the most outstanding long songs of the 1970s.

Whilst Clinton\\'s previous works had had some fine moments like \"You And Your Folks\" and \"Super Stupid\" on 1971\\'sMaggot Brain, it was only withChocolate Citythat the band began to tighten up their dense funk enough to serious attract listeners.On \"Mothership Connection\", Clinton and his backing group turn to a conceptual masterpiece about the struggle of funk against the rest of the world and those who would destroy it. Whilst this might seem as cliched as AC/DC\\'s songs praising the power of rock\\'n\\'roll, it does not come off that way. This is because Clinton never deals in the shameless machismo that made and makes AC/DC so annoying, nor is he as stridently preachy and instead comes across as intimately calling people to join him.Despite its title, \"Mothership Connection\" lacks the overt femininity of contemporary masterpieces byCanorRoxy Music. The rhythms are much tighter, but there are still clear traces of the expressive melody seen to great advantage in the work of those above-mentioned bands. This prevents P-Funk ever moving toward the awful machismo of 1980s and 1990s rap. Moreover, the intensity of the rhythms on \"Mothership Connection\", especially on the opening track \"P-Funk (Wants To Get Funked Up)\" is very subtle: it takes time to appreciate how different this is from the dance music that populated commerical radio in the time of \"Mothership Connection\".The title track \"Mothership Connection (Star Child)\" fires continuously and features some stragely melodic vocal work on the famous line \"swing low, sweet chariot\" that really fits in with Clinton\\'s remarkably well-executed conceptual aim. \"Unfunky UFO\" is quietly touching like the best music always should be, but never loses its fiery rhythmic drive or its feeling of joyful hope, whilst \"Handcuffs\" is the most beautiful song on the record and could almost be onAvalonif it were not for the big soul voice. Yet, the varied voices only add emotion and feeling to the song rather than make it annoying. \"Give Up The Funk (Tear The Roof Off The Sucker)\" is the most \"jam\"-like song here, but it still has a rare capacity to lure a listener in with repeated listens owing to the varied tone of the vocals and the repetitive, almost mantra-like lyrics. The music is actually very soft and its resonance and the chant near the end of the song fits its mood wonderfull well.All in all, \"Mothership Connection\" is a rare work of subtle intensity that is actually quite beautiful, whist at the same time being arguably the best \"concept\" album made this side ofHounds of Love.

He was from a Jewish family in pre-Quiet Revolution Montreal, and had been a published poet for over a decade before actually recording songs. The result is that his vocals were never trained and Cohen had a reputation as one of rock\\'s first \"non-singers\".The effect of being in his thirties, however, was that Cohen was able to take a very different attitude towards the cultural changes that were taking place in the late 1960s - one which unlike Bob Dylan or Joni Mitchell placed him well out of the mainstream and meant that only his first two albums ever dented the Top 100 on Billboard. (In Europe, where Cohen was viewed as a romantic, he had such a large following that he managed to chart on a regular basis into the 1990s). Whereas Dylan and Mitchell had a rock orientation in their focus on the steel-string guitar, Cohen generally used a nylon-string guitar and a spartan string orchestra to accompany his vocals. The results can only be described as surprising in their simple beauty, and even as catchy.The opener \"Suzanne\" (which I confused for a long time with a song bythe Holliessets the tone with simple, almost classical poetry that has remarkable delicacy to it. Cohen\\'s often-criticised voice was for me not a hard taste to acquire: indeed I found quite easily the reason it fits what he wrote so well. The following track \"Master Song\" is a mini-epic of the relationship between people that can be described as very conservative (did John J. Miller miss this one?) yet it is so tender that it can make one cry. \"Winter Lady\", \"The Stranger Song\" and \"Sisters of Mercy\" follow on this beauty, but on the second side of the original vinyl Cohen, if anything, take the same formula even further.\"So Long, Marianne\" is an epic in the same way as \"Master Song\" but its moving tale of love surpasses it for darkness as well as for emotion, and then \"Hey, That\\'s No Way to Say Goodbye\" takes one into the slow depths of recognising failure in a way people during the late 1960s had little inclination to do. Cohen, no doubt, tells genuine truth about how many people of the Boom Generation failed to form long-lasting relationships, and the three remaining songs on the second side of \"Songs of Leonard Cohen\", if more upbeat, show just how wise Cohen seems with hindsight.All in all, among the male singer/songwriters of the late 1960s and early 1970s no statement more definitive than \"Songs of Leonard Cohen\" exists.Moondancewould be its closest rival, but for all its nature-based mystical passion it is scarcely so wise or compassionate as Cohen\\'s superb debut.

In accordance with this, she mellows out a great deal when compared withNew York Tendaberry- in contrast to her raucous piano playing of that album, here she plays with a deceptively soft, almost precious tone that would forsee Tori Amos by a quarter of a century. This is evident of the epic \"Map To The Treasure\", where she describes an epic tale of finding a lonely woman described as \"the treasure of love\". \"Brown Earth\" is another masterpiece, but this time moving towards the poppy sound ofEli And The Thirteenth Confession. \"Blackpatch\" is the most purely funk-oriented song on the album, and showcases Nyro\\'s angelic voice at its best. \"Been On A Train\" and \"Up On The Roof\" are beautiful and ballad-like in tone, and their lush sound was to influence many later white-soul musicians.The intro to \"Beads Of Sweat\" describes the desolate environment of the spiritual seeker with a beauty it would take Jane Siberry to match (\"I pricked my fingers on the thorns\" is actually a real description of Native American mystical rites), and then the song turns into a funky rhythm faintly echoing mid-80s Prince.The final track \"Christmas In My Soul\" is a soulful (almost gospel influence) piano-based ballad with a spiritual sense that would forsee the way forHounds Of Love, as Nyro gives a beautiful call for peace, aided by her slowest piano playing, which makes this track very difficult to appreciate, especially when it slows down after the intro section. Yet Nyro never loses her passion for a completely new type of social and spiritual vision, always calling for love and understanding - check out the line \"you\\'ve got no guts, no gospel\", which is honestly quite scary.The sophistication and subtlety of Laura Nyro, and her influence on much pop-oriented music in the 70s and 80s, has led many critics to dimiss Laura Nyro - Robert Christgau once referred to her as a \"fool\". Yet, listening today toUnder The PinkorMaria, one can see that Laura Nyro was in fact a highly influential artist - her independence and spiritual musings were what paved the way for the modern-day female singer/songwriter to emerge. Without \"Christmas And The Beads Of Sweat\", it is hard to imagine how Kate Bush could have developed the mysticism so evident onHounds Of Love.All in all, whilstNew York Tendaberryis recommended as an introduction to Laura Nyro, if you love that album (recommended to all serious music lovers) you should try this one, even though it does take more listens to appreciate.It is an illustration of the way in which Nyro\\'s complex, interpesonal narratives have been discredited by the punk-and-grunge admiring rock crit establishment that Laura Nyro does not have a single \"Essential Recording By Year\" or her own \"Essential Recordings\" on [...].

Laura Nyro, however, wanted to pay tribute to her soul roots after running out of her own songs to record after the wonderful, but quiet and consequently very challengingChristmas And The Beads Of Sweatthe previous year.The result was \"Gonna Take A Miracle\", an album of covers from the Motown and Brill Building soul eras recorded with vocal group LaBelle (Patti LaBelle, Nona Hendyx and Sarah Dash). In general, the huge hooks and frantic tempo changes ofNew York Tendaberrycould never be seen here, nor can the amazingly soft delicacy ofChristmas And The Beads Of Sweat. Instead, the tone was impressionistic in nature yet still intense and leaving one with a sense of amazement, especially in the power of the vocals in the magical medley \"Monkey Time/Dancing In The Street\" and \"Jimmy Mack\", where Nyro\\'s superb vocal was truely breathtaking.The impressionistic tone and the absence of Nyro\\'s own hyperfeminine lyrical style makes \"Gonna Take A Miracle\" the most palatable Nyro for the non-cultist (as can be clearly seen in many album guides). Yet, its impressionistic tone was also out of place with the development of heavy metal that was taking place at the time \"Gonna Take A Miracle\" came out. At the same time, the tone managed to retain the sheer brilliance ofNew York TendaberryandChristmas And The Beads Of Sweatand does not go back to the rather thinFirst Songs.The beautiful, atmospheric ballad \"The Wind\" contained the only traces of the extraordinary softness ofChristmas And The Beads Of Sweat, and \"Desiree\", though more accessible, was equally beautiful. Apart from the a capella opener \"I Met Him On A Sunday\", the rest of \"Gonna Take A Miracle\" was the most accessible work Nyro ever did, consisting of upbeat, joyful soul-pop songs such as \"Nowhere To Run\" (where LaBelle themselves take on lead vocals) and \"You\\'ve Really Got A Hold On Me\". Generally Nyro\\'s piano was not nearly so prominent as on her previous three albums of original material, but she still showed her skill in the sparse playing of \"The Wind\" and \"Spanish Harlem\" (which was the origin of one of her line in the amazing \"Map To The Treasure\" off her previous album).LaBelle themselves added superb harmony vocals throughout the album and managed to match Nyro\\'s angelic voice throughout without missing a beat - surprising since the album was recorded from first takes due to shortage of time - though Nyro did tour extensively to support it before retiring for several years.The impressionism and vocal stylings of \"Gonna Take A Miracle\" were an inspiration in later years for such artists as the Roches and even recalls ESG\\'s wonderfulA South Bronx Story. Nonetheless, despite not selling as well as its accessibility suggests it ought to have (perhaps due to the fact that a covers\\' album was too novel for many back in 1972), \"Gonna Take A Miracle\" remains a good introduction to Nyro for the uninitiated - if one cannot handle this, one would have no hope of getting through Nyro\\'s albums of original material with their complex, hyperfeminine lyrical style.', 'overall': 5.0, 'summary': 'Magical again, and most palatable Nyro for an outsider', 'unixReviewTime': 1038441600, 'reviewTime': '11 28, 2002'}, {'reviewerID': 'AKNSC7IXWEYLA', 'asin': 'B000002562', 'reviewerName': 'mianfei', 'helpful': [6, 8], 'reviewText': '\"Smile\", released after a five-year hiatus, was the late Laura Nyro\\'s last album to even remotely sell, and her first after moving to Danbury in rural Connecticut afterGonna Take A Miracle.The intervening years clearly took their toll on Nyro\\'s ability to produce virtuosic piano workouts, and most of \"Smile\" was much simpler than the wonderfulEli And The Thirteenth Confession,New York TendaberryandChristmas And The Beads Of Sweat, all of which showed Laura Nyro to be an incredibly talented performer capable of extraordinarily difficult tempo, volume and chord changes put together seamlessly and logically.Nonetheless, \"Smile\" continued the softening of sound evident on the difficultChristmas And The Beads Of Sweat, though the sound lacked the unique delicacy and dreaminess of that album and was generally slow and melancholy - indeed tearful. The opener, a cover of \"Sexy Mama\", announced this with its folksy guitar intro and jazzy melodies.\"Children Of The Junks\" was an excellent song that, though not different from \"Sexy Mama\" in musical tone, showed that Nyro\\'s unique combination of sheer literacy and harsh realism in her lyrics had not deserted her (it stood almost as a far more accessible version of \"Been On A Train\"). \"Money\" upped the tone somewhat with a funky groove akin to \"Beads Of Sweat\" and Nyro\\'s hatred of playing the game of commercialism (\"I feel like a pawn in my own world\") and her distate for environmental distraction (the brilliant \"in the city machines/where industries/fill the fish full of mercury\").\"I Am The Blues\" was a very sad yet fairly accessible song in which Nyro told a brilliant tale of being lonely, aided by some superb poetry (\"maybe Mars has good news\" and \"in a world of war/I can\\'t find my laughter\"), whilst \"Stormy Love\" was a simple yet hooky song, possibly the most immediate original song Nyro recorded - the vocal was superb and passionate. \"The Cat Song\" was the most playful track on the album, and showed Nyro\\'s affection for animals (a prominent theme in her later life) in the way she imagined herself to be a cat.However, the last two songs were disappointing by Nyro\\'s standards, and prevented \"Smile\" from being any masterpiece.Not in the class ofNew York TendaberryorChristmas And The Beads Of Sweat, but an impressive work nonetheless.', 'overall': 4.0, 'summary': 'Lacked the sheer wonderment, but excellent nonetheless', 'unixReviewTime': 1037923200, 'reviewTime': '11 22, 2002'}, {'reviewerID': 'AKNSC7IXWEYLA', 'asin': 'B000002564', 'reviewerName': 'mianfei', 'helpful': [0, 35], 'reviewText': 'Boz Scaggs, who had been in the music business for a long time and even made a record with Duane Allman in the 1960s, had recorded some fairly unsuccessful solo albums during the early part of the 1970s before \"Silk Degrees\" make him into a pop superstar.Today, there is relatively little criticism of middle-of-the-road music from the 1970s vis-&agrave;-vis what came out of the 1980s, presumably because the production is not generally so dated or because it is seen as having fewer associations with \"rock\".

The fierce third track \"Cradle and All\" has a particularly impressive opening that rings even more powerfully than \"Out of Range\", and \"Shy\" is not far behind. The slower tunes, however, lack equally the sheer power and starkness one would expect after listening to her first few albums.All in all, even with some good songs on it, \"Not a Pretty Girl\" is the beginning of the end for Ani DiFranco as one of the outstanding talents of the 1990s.

Instead of the sharp, stark, yet often beautiful sound of her first five albums, \"Dilate\" too often sounds just like the overblown posturing ofAlanis Morrisette.

Such songs as \"Gaucho\" itself, which tries far too hard to be humorous and \"Third World Man\" are quite emotionless and much too light for a band that once put out pieces like \"Bodhissatva\", \"Do It Again\", \"Change of the Guard\" or \"The Royal Scam\". The \"Bodhissatva\" sequel, \"Time Out of Mind\", with Dire Straits\\' Mark Knopfler guesting on guitar, has lyrics that impress in spite of being almost overtly religious (I admit I never saw that when I first listened) but the music, in spite of a clear, dense vocal from Fagen, could have sounded much better were the production crisper and more intense. The opener \"Babylon Sisters\", whose chorus should have rocked quite hard, suffers from the same problem and the song becomes less than exciting after years of listening.Nonetheless, \"Gaucho\" does contain two absolutely classic Steely Dan tracks that save it from being a waste of time. \"Hey Nineteen\" is pure funk with a wonderful lyric about the dreams of youth back in the late 1960s - and it has the same crispness and power the Dan produced time and time again on their first five albums. \"Glamour Profession\", a brilliantly-weaved tale of the underground criminal life of a professional basketballer, on the other hand uses the light production to create a psychedelic atmosphere that is truly hypnotic yet catchy. It is a pity the Dan were unable to replicate this sense of atmosphere more often on their last two albums before the breakup. When they try on the chorus of \"My Rival\", however, it shows how difficult creating one song like \"Glamour Profession\" actually is.All in all, despite two excellent songs, \"Gaucho\" is a rather disappointing farewell considering what the Dan did on their first five albums.

This change of tone is illustrated right from the opening track \"Rikki Don\\'t Lost That Number\", which became their only hit on the Australian singles charts, and is a relatively straightforward piano ballad that lacks the amazing story-in-song character of their best work. However, with the second track \"Night By Night\", the Dan show that they can transform the slow-burn psychedelia of \"Show Biz Kids\" from their previous album onto pure pop. The precise, staccato horn riff is totally memorable, as are the lyrics. The slower \"Barrytown\" carries on from this with a beauty that is genuinely sly, as does the more familiar of never-played-on-radio \"Any Major Dude Will Tell You\". \"Parker\\'s Band\" is a dense, driving piece that is amazingly tuneful: so much so that is seems as much like electrified jazz as Miles Davis and Ornette Coleman on their fusion works ever did.\"Through With Buzz\" is the shortest song Steely Dan ever put onto record, but it is really funny and to the point. The same is true of the acoustic \"With A Gun\", but the title tune moves back to the fierce and catchy jazz/pop of the best moments earlier on \"Pretzel Logic\". The vocals are unusually melodic for Fagen, but are even more effective, and the story of a failed rock star is written in a way that removes almost all the usual limitations of the genre.

From tales of ecological devastation to immigrant lives, Fagen\\'s lyrics were much better than anyone in rock at the time and have rarely been equalled (Paddy McAloon of Prefab Sprout and Tori Amos on her first two albums come close).After the masterfulThe Royal Scam, Steely Dan became even more of a studio band than before with \"Aja\". The story of how the band\\'s notorious perfectionism led to songs being given tens of takes to complete is well-known, but the trouble is that whereas this perfectionist style made for music that expressed the feelings of their lyrics remarkably well on previous releases, on \"Aja\" it is fair to say the Dan took it beyond anything reasonable. As so often in the early days of overlayering, it serves merely to reduce the emotional level of the music.\"Black Cow\", the opening track, is very catchy but does not really match previous openers like \"Black Friday\" or \"Do It Again\" despite the band trying quite wholeheartedly to be more pretty than they were meant to be.

The former is a love song that is simultaneously simple and intricate, whilst \"Josie\" might seem to be about the Vestal Virgins (akin to \"Whiter Shade of Pale\") but fires like nothing else on the album in terms of tight, yet complex and changeable, playing.Nonetheless, even two good tracks to finish are not enough to prevent \"Aja\" from being a major let down after five albums with hardly a weak track.

However, overall, it lacks the creativity and fire not only of its predecessor, but also of its follow-upInnervisions. This absence is most apparent on the slower pieces on the first side of the record: neither \"You Are The Sunshine of My Life\" nor \"You and I\" has the moving quality of such songs as \"Happier than the Morning Sun\", \"Girl Blue\" or even \"Golden Lady\". The romantic pieces on the second side, especially the touchingly beautiful \"Blame It on the Sun\", do make up for this to a considerable extent. Nevertheless, no matter how hard he tries Stevie Wonder never had the voice to emulate a song like\"Sunset\": he would have been better sticking to a slightly more funkier style. The message of \"Big Brother\" also sounds rather too muted to be as effective as it might have been.However, there is reason for \"Talking Book\"\\'s exalted reputation when one moves to the more uptempo material. The little-known \"Tuesday Heartbreak\" stands as a true gem with its remarkably finely put-together electronic funk and a vocal from Wonder whose piercing power might not be expected even from a fan. The combination of piano and synthesiser was never matched by Ferry and Eno. The midtempo \"You\\'ve Got it Bad Girl\" has a pleasingly jazzy feel and is the best pure love song on \"Talking Book.\" It is with the really \"tough\" material that \"Talking Book\" proves Wonder capable of so much more than almost every other musician. Second track \"Maybe Your Baby\", featuring Ray Parker Junior ofGhostbustersfame, has melodies that are amazingly tuneful yet so distorted as to be passionate in a harsh kind of way.

Bands like andTelevisionandTuxedomoonwere able to move beyond the mechanical formula of short, loud and fast songs to create music whose freedom and spontaneity still resonates today. Another legacy of the \"punk revolution\" that has had some noteworthy consequences is the emergence of all-female or mainly female groups playing their own instruments. Whilst in many cases this has led to situations where women try to sing with a violently angry tone which, as the brilliant writer \"janitor-x\" once said, is always awkward, in other cases it has allowed for the making of spontaneous, free-flowing music that moves far beyond the overblown character of so much rock music of the period and since.The Slits are the perfect example of this contradiction. Intheir early careerthey were a generic punk band only played by girls, but their passion to make music drove them here to much greater deeds. Instead of simply playing generic rock and roll, on \"Cut\" the Slits devise a totally different sound of jerky, though not dense rhythms and a vocal style that benefits greatly by being so untrained. Instead of just trying to play enthusiatically for the sake of aggression as they did, the Slits play with a truly childlike spontaneity that is indeed refreshing.

I loved all his underground stuff and his albums up to  \"The Eminem Show\". After that, his music took a big decline. This album is no different. When I saw there were 20 tracks on there, it was a key indicator that there would be a lot of garbage on the album. 4 of the tracks are extremely stupid skits and the other 16 are sub par tracks with weak lyrics. What really pisses me off is Eminem shows no growth as an emcee at all. HIs subject matter is tired and wack. I got tired of hearing about drugs, fantasy killings, and him dropping names of people that don\\'t have anything to do with hip hop. The beats on this album are average at best.

The beats are catchy but after awhile they all sound the same. One beat is not unique over the other. The Lyrics? They are terrible . I don't like jeezy's flow, it is lethargic and lazy and he never changes it up (repetitive). Nas Killed him on his own track due to jezzy does not know how to be versatile with his lyrics and the way he delivers the lyric. Not to mention that his voice is down right annoying.

LL has managed to continually make these soft, sugar side of the shredded wheat albums and then has the audacity to call himself the \"GOAT\". You can be considered the GOAT if you can make dope albums consistently, as well as make music that anybody can appeal to. There are only so many \"love\" songs with wack guest appearances I can listen to. On this album LL keeps talking about if he is relevant or not, and even tries to drop a political joint (MR. PRESIDENT). Well he isn\\'t relevant, and hasn\\'t been in years and the political joint sounded ridiculous. I kept picturing him talking to the president and licking his lips over and over through the whole conversation (YUCK). Anyway there are like two songs on the album that are just ok. The beats are average, and the guest appearances are extra weak (Fat Joe sucks). Most ladies like LL due to the way he looks not his skills.

The beats as well as the hooks on these songs are weak. Jeezy sucks and I didn't like the way Cube was flowing on the track.

Sullivan almost comes off as a female keith Sweat.The lyrics were poorly written. It gets old when 90 percent of the album is about how needy she is for a man, or being destructive because she lost a man. Most men don\\'t like women like that so they definitely don\\'t want to hear songs like that.Besides Need U bad there wasn\\'t really a song that grabbed me to listen to it more than once. The beats are average and very forgettable.All in all I am very disappointed with this release. Sullivan either needs to get someone else to write some good lyrics for her or she needs to make a living singing hooks on various rappers songs.

The hooks blew me because all of them had fake roger troutman-t pain synthesized sounf to them. Busta messed up because it seems as though he is trying to cater to a younger audience when the younger audience is not his fan base.

While I respect jadakiss as a lyricist, i never really liked a complete album from him. This album is a little different from prior releases in my opinion. It seem s as though Jada has grown by talking about a little more conscious topics in conjunction with having some party stuff and gangsta stuff. The album has a nice blend of all the aspects mentioned. The album has nice guest appearances especially the verse from Ghostface! Ghost killed it on it on CARTEL GATHERING and Jazmine Sullivan did a good job on the hook of SMOKING GUN. There are a few songs that i didn't care for that prevented this album from being a 5 star album.
